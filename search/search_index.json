Additionally, each test file name must start with <code>test_</code> and end with <code>.py</code>. So, first, you can create a test file for the <code>Box.sol</code> contract:</p> <pre><code>touch tests/test_box.py\n</code></pre> <p>In addition to the test file, you can create a <code>conftest.py</code> file that will define a couple of essential fixtures. Fixtures allow you to define functions that set up the necessary environment or resources to run your tests. Note that while the <code>Box.sol</code> contract is simple, incorporating fixtures into your testing process is good practice.</p> <p>To create the file, you can run the following command:</p> <pre><code>touch tests/conftest.py\n</code></pre> <p>Since your tests will rely on the injection of the fixtures, you must define the fixtures first. When defining fixtures, you need to apply the <code>pytest.fixture</code> decorator above each function. For this example, you'll create two fixtures: one that defines the owner of the contract and one that deploys the contract from the owner's account.</p> <p>The <code>owner</code> fixture will use the built-in <code>accounts</code> fixture to take the first account in the list of test accounts provided by Ape and return it. The <code>box</code> fixture will deploy the <code>Box</code> contract type using the built-in <code>project</code> fixture, you simply have to provide the name of the contract and use the <code>owner</code> fixture to deploy it.</p> tests/conftest.py<pre><code>import pytest\n\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef owner(accounts):\n    return accounts[0]\n\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef box(owner, project):\n    return owner.deploy(project.Box)\n</code></pre> <p>Now that you've created the fixtures, you can start creating your tests. Each test function name must start with <code>test_</code> and describe what the test does. For this example, you can use <code>test_store_value</code>, as you'll create a test for the <code>store</code> function. The test will store a value and then retrieve it, asserting that the retrieved value is equal to the value passed into the <code>store</code> function.</p> <p>To use the <code>owner</code> and <code>box</code> fixtures, you must pass them into your test function, which will inject the fixtures automatically for you to use. The <code>owner</code> account will be used to call the <code>store</code> function of the <code>box</code> contract instance.</p> tests/test_box.py<pre><code>def test_store_value(box, owner):\n    new_value = 5\n    box.store(new_value, sender=owner)\n    assert box.retrieve() == new_value\n</code></pre> <p>And that's it! That's all you'll need inside your test file. You can use the following command to run the test:</p> <pre><code>ape test\n</code></pre> <p>The results of running the test will be printed to the terminal.</p> ape test ===================== test session starts ====================== platform darwin -- Python 3.10.4, pytest-7.2.1, pluggy-1.4.0 rootdir: /Users/moonbeam/ape plugins: eth-ape-0.7.7, web3-6.15.1 collected 1 item tests/test_box.py .

If you want to learn more about how ABI-encoding works, the Solidity documentation for ABI is helpful.

When writing code that ends with a semicolon (<code>;</code>), Chisel will run it as a statement, storing its value in Chisel's runtime state. But if you only needed to see how the ABI-encoded data was represented, then you could get away with running the code as an expression.

Since Moonbeam is Ethereum-compatible, you can use Hardhat to develop and deploy smart contracts on Moonbeam.</p> <p>Hardhat takes a task-based approach to development, where you can define and execute tasks that perform specific actions. These actions include compiling and deploying contracts, running tests, and more. Tasks are highly configurable, so you can create, customize, and execute tasks that are tailored to meet your needs.</p> <p>You can also extend Hardhat's functionality through the use of plugins. Plugins are external extensions that integrate with Hardhat to provide additional features and tools for your workflow. For example, there are plugins for common Ethereum libraries, like Ethers.js and viem, a plugin that extends the Chai assertion library to include Ethereum-specific functionality, and more. All of these plugins can be used to extend your Hardhat project on Moonbeam.</p> <p>This guide will provide a brief introduction to Hardhat and show you how to use Hardhat to compile, deploy, and debug Ethereum smart contracts on the Moonbase Alpha TestNet. This guide can also be adapted for Moonbeam, Moonriver, or a Moonbeam development node.</p> <p>Please note that although Hardhat comes with a Hardhat Network component, which provides a local development environment, you should use a local Moonbeam development node instead.

With Tenderly, you can build, debug, test, optimize, monitor, set up alerts, and view analytics for your smart contracts on Moonbeam and Moonriver.</p> <p>The Tenderly platform provides the following features:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Contract Verification - as it is essential to verify your smart contracts to take full advantage of all of Tenderly's features, Tenderly provides several methods of verification. You can verify smart contracts through the Tenderly dashboard, the Tenderly CLI and Foundry, or the Tenderly Hardhat plugin</p> </li> <li> <p>Debugger - use the visual debugger to inspect transactions and get better insight into the behavior of your code. With the debugger, you can review a transaction's stack trace, view the calls made in a transaction, step through a contract, and review decoded inputs, outputs, and state variables. You can use the debugger on the Tenderly dashboard or the Tenderly Debugger Chrome Extension</p> </li> <li> <p>Gas Profiler - view how much gas you're spending on a granular level, so you can optimize your smart contracts and reduce transaction gas costs</p> </li> <li> <p>Simulator - simulate transactions in a forked development environment to learn how your transactions will behave without having to send them on-chain. This way, you can know the outcome of the transaction and make sure it works as expected before sending it to the network. You can experiment with different parameters, simulate historical and current transactions, and edit the contract source code. You can access the simulator from the Tenderly dashboard or you can use the Tenderly Simulation API to take advantage of the simulator programmatically</p> </li> <li> <p>Forks - this feature simulates the live Moonbeam network in an isolated environment, which enables you to interact with deployed contracts and live on-chain data. Forking also takes transaction simulations a step further by enabling you to chain multiple simulations together chronologically. This allows for the testing of complex transaction scenarios where one transaction depends upon another, with the benefit of using live on-chain data. There are some limitations to be aware of when using Tenderly's forking feature. You cannot interact with any of the Moonbeam precompiled contracts and their functions. Precompiles are a part of the Substrate implementation and therefore cannot be replicated in the simulated EVM environment. This prohibits you from interacting with cross-chain assets on Moonbeam and Substrate-based functionality such as staking and governance</p> </li> <li> <p>Alerting - configure real-time alerts to notify you whenever a specific event occurs, allowing you to stay informed about what's going on with your smart contracts</p> </li> <li> <p>Web3 Actions - create programmable functions in JavaScript or TypeScript that are executed automatically by Tenderly when a specific smart contract or chain event occurs</p> </li> <li> <p>Analytics - visualize transaction and on-chain data to get useful insights into what's going on with your project. You can use Tenderly's analytics builder or create custom queries and scripts to meet your analytic needs</p> </li> <li> <p>Sandbox - write, compile, execute, and debug your smart contracts directly in your browser with baked-in JavaScript and Solidity editors. Every time you run your code, Tenderly creates a temporary fork that comes with 10 pre-funded accounts, each with 100 tokens for testing purposes</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>Moonbeam and Moonriver is fully supported by Tenderly with the exception of the Web3 Gateway.

The precompiles allow you to call the Substrate runtime directly which is not normally accessible from the Ethereum side of Moonbeam.</p> <p>The Substrate code responsible for implementing precompiles can be found in the EVM pallet. The EVM pallet includes the standard precompiles found on Ethereum and some additional precompiles that are not specific to Ethereum. It also provides the ability to create and execute custom precompiles through the generic <code>Precompiles</code> trait. There are several custom Moonbeam-specific precompiles that have been created, all of which can be found in the Moonbeam codebase.</p> <p>The Ethereum precompiled contracts contain complex functionality that is computationally intensive, such as hashing and encryption. The custom precompiled contracts on Moonbeam provide access to Substrate-based functionality such as staking, governance, XCM-related functions, and more.</p> <p>The Moonbeam-specific precompiles can be interacted with through familiar and easy-to-use Solidity interfaces using the Ethereum API, which are ultimately used to interact with the underlying Substrate interface. This flow is depicted in the following diagram:</p> <p></p> <p>Note</p> <p>There can be some unintended consequences when using the precompiled contracts on Moonbeam.

The functions that can be called by anyone are as follows:</p> identity(address who) - returns registration information for a given account Parameters <ul> <li><code>who</code> - address of the account to query the identity information for</li> </ul> superOf(address who) - retrieves the super account for a sub-account. If the given account is not a sub-account, the address returned is <code>0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000</code> Parameters <ul> <li><code>who</code> - address of the account to query the super-account for</li> </ul> subsOf(address who) - returns the sub-accounts for a given account. If the given account doesn't have any sub-accounts, an empty array is returned (<code>[]</code>) Parameters <ul> <li><code>who</code> - address of the account to query the sub-accounts for</li> </ul> registrars() - returns the list of registrars Parameters <p>None.</p> setIdentity(IdentityInfo memory info) - sets the identity for the caller Parameters <ul> <li><code>info</code> - IdentityInfo memory struct containing the identity information to be set</li> </ul> setSubs(SubAccount[] memory subs) - sets the sub-accounts for the caller Parameters <ul> <li><code>subs</code> - SubAccount[] memory array containing the sub-accounts to be set</li> </ul> clearIdentity() - clears the identity for the caller Parameters <p>None.</p> requestJudgement(uint32 regIndex, uint256 maxFee) - requests judgment from a given registrar along with the maximum fee the caller is willing to pay Parameters <ul> <li><code>regIndex</code> - uint32 index of the registrar to request judgment from</li> <li><code>maxFee</code> - uint256 maximum fee the caller is willing to pay for the judgment</li> </ul> cancelRequest(uint32 regIndex) - cancels the caller's request for judgment from a given registrar Parameters <ul> <li><code>regIndex</code> - uint32 index of the registrar to cancel the judgment request from</li> </ul> addSub(address sub, Data memory data) - adds a sub-identity account for the caller Parameters <ul> <li><code>sub</code> - address of the sub-account to add</li> <li><code>data</code> - Data memory struct containing the sub-account information</li> </ul> renameSub(address sub, Data memory data) - renames a sub-identity account for the caller Parameters <ul> <li><code>sub</code> - address of the sub-account to rename</li> <li><code>data</code> - Data memory struct containing the new sub-account information</li> </ul> removeSub(address sub) - removes a sub identity account for the caller Parameters <ul> <li><code>sub</code> - address of the sub-account to remove</li> </ul> quitSub(address sub) - removes the caller as a sub-identity account Parameters <ul> <li><code>sub</code> - address of the sub-account to quit</li> </ul> <p>The judgment-related functions that must be called by a registrar and the caller must be the registrar account that corresponds to the <code>regIndex</code> are:</p> setFee(uint32 regIndex, uint256 fee) - sets the fee for a registar Parameters <ul> <li><code>regIndex</code> - uint32 index of the registrar setting the fee</li> <li><code>fee</code> - uint256 new fee amount to be set for the registrar</li> </ul> setAccountId(uint32 regIndex,

A VRF is a cryptographic function that takes some input and produces random values, along with a proof of authenticity that these random values were generated by the submitter. The proof can be verified by anyone to ensure the random values generated were calculated correctly.</p> <p>There are two available sources of randomness that provide random inputs based on block producers' VRF keys and past randomness results: local VRF and BABE epoch randomness. Local VRF is determined directly within Moonbeam using the collator of the block's VRF key and the last block's VRF output. On the other hand, BABE epoch randomness is based on all the VRF produced by the relay chain validators during a complete epoch.</p> <p>For more information on the two sources of randomness, how the request and fulfillment process works, and security considerations, please refer to the Randomness on Moonbeam page.</p> <p>Moonbeam provides a randomness precompile, which is a Solidity interface that enables smart contract developers to generate randomness via local VRF or BABE epoch randomness using the Ethereum API. Moonbeam also provides a randomness consumer Solidity contract that your contract must inherit from in order to consume fulfilled randomness requests.</p> <p>This guide will show you how to use the randomness precompile and randomness consumer contract to create a lottery where the winners will randomly be selected. You'll also learn how to interact with the randomness precompile directly to perform actions such as purging an expired randomness request.</p> <p>The randomness precompile is located at the following address:</p> MoonbeamMoonriverMoonbase Alpha <pre><code>0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000809\n</code></pre> <pre><code>0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000809\n</code></pre> <pre><code>0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000809\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>There can be some unintended consequences when using the precompiled contracts on Moonbeam.

The GMP precompile does not assist with a route from parachains back to Moonbeam and subsequently, Wormhole-connected chains.    </p> <p>To send liquidity from a Wormhole-connected origin chain like Ethereum, users must invoke the <code>transferTokensWithPayload</code> method on the origin-chain's deployment of the WormholeTokenBridge smart contract. This function requires a bytes payload, which must be formatted as a SCALE encoded multilocation object wrapped within another precompile-specific versioned type.</p> <p>You may be unfamiliar with SCALE encoding and multilocations if you are unfamiliar with the Polkadot ecosystem. SCALE encoding is a compact form of encoding that Polkadot uses. The <code>MultiLocation</code> type is used to define a relative point in Polkadot, such as a specific account on a specific parachain (Polkadot blockchain).  </p> <p>Moonbeam\u2019s GMP protocol requires a multilocation to represent the destination for liquidity routing, which most likely means an account on another parachain. Whatever it is, this destination must be expressed as relative to Moonbeam.  </p> <p>Remember</p> <p>Multilocations being relative is important, because a parachain team may erroneously give you a multilocation relative to their own chain, which can be different. Providing an incorrect multilocation can result in loss of funds!</p> <p>Each parachain will have its specific methods of interpreting a multilocation, and should confirm with the project that the multilocation that you formed is correct. However, you will most likely be forming a multilocation with an account.</p> <p>Multiple types of accounts can be included in a multilocation, which you must know beforehand when constructing your multilocation. The two most common are:</p> <ul> <li>AccountKey20 \u2014 an account ID that is 20-bytes in length, including Ethereum-compatible account IDs such as those on Moonbeam</li> <li>AccountId32 \u2014 an account ID that is 32-bytes in length, standard in Polkadot and its parachains</li> </ul> <p>The following multilocation templates target accounts on other parachains with Moonbeam as the relative origin. To use them, replace <code>INSERT_PARACHAIN_ID</code> with the parachain ID of the network you wish to send funds to and replace <code>INSERT_ADDRESS</code> with the address of the account you want to send funds to on that parachain.  </p> AccountId32AccountKey20 <pre><code>{\n  V4: {\n    parents: 1,\n    interior: {\n      X2: [\n        { Parachain: 'INSERT_PARACHAIN_ID' },\n        {\n          AccountId32: {\n            id: 'INSERT_ADDRESS',\n          },\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n};\n</code></pre> <pre><code>{\n  V4: {\n    parents: 1,\n    interior: {\n      X2: [\n        { Parachain: 'INSERT_PARACHAIN_ID' },\n        {\n          AccountKey20: {\n            key: 'INSERT_ADDRESS',\n          },\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  }\n};\n</code></pre> <p>It can be challenging to correctly SCALE encode the entire payload without the right tools, mainly due to the custom types expected by the precompile.

An example would be approving a smart contract's access to a token, then transferring it. With the batch precompile, developers can enhance user experience with batched transactions as it minimizes the number of transactions a user is required to confirm to one. Additionally, gas fees can be reduced since batching avoids multiple base gas fees (the initial 21000 units of gas spent to begin a transaction).</p> <p>The precompile interacts directly with Substrate's EVM pallet.

However, this guide will break it down into steps that are easy to follow. Before making any changes, you should obtain the existing value corresponding to the key (i.e., the account in this case). You can go to Chain State on Polkadot.js Apps and query the System pallet by providing the account you'd like to query. Upon submitting the query, you'll get back a readable account structure like so:</p> <pre><code>{\n  nonce: 3,142\n  consumers: 2\n  providers: 1\n  sufficients: 6\n  data: {\n    free: 1,278,606,392,142,175,328,676\n    reserved: 348,052,500,000,000,000,000\n    frozen: 20,413,910,106,633,175,872\n    flags: 170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,303,715,884,105,728\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>While this is useful as a reference, the information you're looking for is the encoded storage key, which is accessible even without submitting the chain state query.

In very simple terms, SQD can be thought of as an ETL (extract, transform, and load) tool with a GraphQL server included. It enables comprehensive filtering, pagination, and even full-text search capabilities.</p> <p>SQD has native and full support for both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Substrate data. Since Moonbeam is a Substrate-based smart contact platform that is EVM-compatible, SQD can be used to index both EVM and Substrate-based data. SQD offers a Substrate Archive and Processor and an EVM Archive and Processor. The Substrate Archive and Processor can be used to index both Substrate and EVM data. This allows developers to extract on-chain data from any of the Moonbeam networks and process EVM logs as well as Substrate entities (events, extrinsics, and storage items) in one single project and serve the resulting data with one single GraphQL endpoint. If you exclusively want to index EVM data, it is recommended to use the EVM Archive and Processor.</p> <p>This quick-start guide will show you how to create Substrate and EVM projects with SQD and configure it to index data on Moonbeam.

The processor fetches historical on-chain data from an Archive, which is a specialized data lake. You'll need to configure your processor to pull data from the Archive that corresponds to the network you are indexing data on:</p> MoonbeamMoonriverMoonbase Alpha <pre><code>const processor = new SubstrateBatchProcessor();\nprocessor.setDataSource({\n  chain: 'INSERT_RPC_API_ENDPOINT',\n  // Resolves to 'https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/moonbeam-mainnet'\n  archive: lookupArchive('moonbeam', {type: 'Substrate', release: 'ArrowSquid'}),\n})\n</code></pre> <pre><code>const processor = new SubstrateBatchProcessor();\nprocessor.setDataSource({\n  chain: 'INSERT_RPC_API_ENDPOINT',\n  // Resolves to 'https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/moonriver-mainnet'\n  archive: lookupArchive('moonriver', {type: 'Substrate', release: 'ArrowSquid'}),\n})\n</code></pre> <pre><code>const processor = new SubstrateBatchProcessor();\nprocessor.setDataSource({\n  chain: 'https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network',\n  // Resolves to 'https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/moonbase-testnet'\n  archive: lookupArchive('moonbase', {type: 'Substrate', release: 'ArrowSquid'}),\n})\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>To configure your project for Moonbeam or Moonriver, you will need to have your own endpoint and API key, which you can get from one of the supported Endpoint Providers.</p> </li> <li> <p>There's one more quick change to make to the template. The SQD Substrate template is configured to process Substrate account types, but Moonbeam uses Ethereum-style accounts. The <code>getTransferEvents</code> function in the <code>src/main.ts</code> file will iterate through the events ingested by <code>processor.ts</code> and store the relevant <code>transfer</code> events in the database. In the <code>getTransferEvents</code> function, remove the ss58 encoding of the <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> fields. In an unmodified Substrate template, the <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> fields are ss58 encoded as shown:</p> <pre><code>from: ss58.codec('kusama').encode(rec.from),\nto: ss58.codec('kusama').encode(rec.to),\n</code></pre> <p>After removing the ss58 encoding, the respective lines are:</p> <pre><code>from: rec.from, \nto: rec.to, \n</code></pre> </li> </ol> <p>And that's all you have to do to configure your SQD project to index Substrate data on Moonbeam!

It is governed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), the API3 DAO. API3 enables developers to access off-chain resources from within their smart contracts without worrying about security implications. API3 makes this possible through Airnodes, which are first-party oracles, and on-chain data feeds sourced from these oracles.</p> <p>Developers can use Airnode to request off-chain data inside their smart contracts on Moonbeam networks. An Airnode is a first-party oracle that pushes off-chain API data to your on-chain contract. Airnode lets API providers easily run their own first-party oracle nodes. That way, they can provide data to any on-chain dApp interested in their services, all without an intermediary.</p> <p>An on-chain smart contract requests the RRP (Request Response Protocol) contract (<code>AirnodeRrpV0.sol</code>) that adds the request to the event logs.

With it, developers can pass messages with arbitrary data, and tokens can be sent across non-parachain blockchains through chain-agnostic GMP protocols</li> <li>Cross-Consensus Message Passing (XCM) - Polkadot's flavor of GMP.

To learn how to build this payload, please refer to the Building the Payload for Wormhole section of the GMP Precompile documentation.</p> <p>Wormhole relies on a set of distributed nodes that monitor the state on several blockchains.

If 2/3rds of Wormhole's signing Guardians validate a particular message, the message becomes approved and can be received on other chains.</p> <p>The Guardian signatures and the message form a proof called a Verified Action Approval (VAA). These VAAs are delivered to their destinations by relayers within the Wormhole network. On the destination chain, the VAA is used to perform an action. In this case, the VAA is passed into the <code>wormholeTransferERC20</code> function of the GMP Precompile, which processes the VAA through the Wormhole bridge contract (which mints the tokens) and relays the tokens to a parachain using XCM messages.

This was a design decision, as it was preferred to treat them as ERC-20s and utilize the native <code>transfer</code> function of the ERC-20 interface. Consequently, XCM instructions handling the XC-20s are only limited to moving funds from one account to another and don't understand the Holding Register that is inherent to the XCM flow</li> <li>Currently, XCM-related pallets limit XCM messages' ability to send tokens with different reserve chains. Consequently, you can't send an XC-20 and set the fee token to be the native parachain token</li> </ul> <p>Note that as of late 2024, the X-Tokens precompile now uses the Polkadot XCM pallet under the hood, replacing the X-Tokens pallet. Parachains using a different pallet must implement their own solution to transfer reserve and non-reserve assets in a single message.</p> <p>As an example, a brief overview of the entire process of sending MRL tokens from a parachain back through Wormhole to a destination chain is as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Send a batch transaction using the <code>batchAll</code> extrinsic of the Utility Pallet that contains the following two calls:<ul> <li><code>xTokens.transferMultiassets</code> - sends xcGLMR and the local XC-20 to the user\u2019s Computed Origin account. The Computed Origin account is a keyless account on Moonbeam that an account on another parachain has control of via XCM</li> <li><code>polkadotXcm.send</code> - with the <code>Transact</code> instruction. Sends a remote EVM call via XCM to the Batch Precompile on Moonbeam, which batches the following two calls into a single remote EVM transaction using the <code>ethereumXcm.transact</code> extrinsic:<ul> <li><code>approve</code> (of the local XC-20 contract) - approves the Wormhole relayer to transfer the local XC-20</li> <li><code>transferTokensWithRelay</code> (of the relayer contract) - calls the <code>transferTokensWithPayload</code> function of the Wormhole TokenBridge smart contract on Moonbeam to transfer the tokens cross-chain, which broadcasts the message for the Wormhole Guardians to pick up</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>The Guardian Network will pick up on the Wormhole transaction and sign it</li> <li>A Wormhole relayer will relay the tokens to the destination chain and destination account</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Now that you have a general idea of the game plan, you can begin implementing it.

VAAs, or verifiable action approvals, are Wormhole\u2019s version of validated cross-chain messages. If 13 out of Wormhole's 19 signing Guardians validate a particular message, the message becomes approved and can be received on other chains. Adjacent to the guardian network (which act as the validators of Wormhole\u2019s protocol) are the network spies. They don\u2019t do any validation work.

Wormhole does not have general relayers available yet, so Wormhole\u2019s architecture requires dApp developers to create and maintain their own specialized relayers (instead of having a relayer that can execute for many different smart contracts). A developer would have to design their own system if they wished to have the contract caller pay for gas on the destination chain. This might seem like a greater amount of work, but it allows for more fine-tuning of how messages are handled.

Wormhole\u2019s VAAs provide emitter (origin) addresses in the form of <code>bytes32</code>, so they are stored and checked as <code>bytes32</code>. To convert an <code>address</code> type to <code>bytes32</code>, you will need to pad an additional 24 zeros. This is because an <code>address</code> value is 20 bytes, less than the 32 for <code>bytes32</code>. Every byte has 2 hexadecimal characters, so:</p> <pre><code>zeros to add = (32 bytes - 20 bytes) * 2 hexadecimal characters\nzeros to add = 24\n</code></pre> <p>For example, if your connected contract\u2019s address was <code>0xaf108eF646c8214c9DD9C13CBC5fadf964Bbe293</code>, you would input the following into Remix:</p> <pre><code>0x000000000000000000000000af108ef646c8214c9dd9c13cbc5fadf964bbe293\n</code></pre> <p>Now use Remix to ensure that your two connected contracts trust each other.

This walkthrough is based off of Wormhole\u2019s relayer-engine GitHub repository, which as of time of writing, is on commit <code>cc0aad4</code>. It\u2019s in relatively active development, which can cause great changes in the structure of the folders.</p> <p>Clone the fork of the relayer-engine that has been prepared specifically for interacting with <code>SimpleGeneralMessage</code>. Docker and npm are required to run this relayer, so be sure to install them to your device.  </p> <p>First things first: the setup. Use the npm package manager to install dependencies (like ethers and the relayer engine itself) using the command line.  </p> <pre><code>npm install\ncd plugins/simplegeneralmessage_plugin\nnpm install \n</code></pre> <p>Once that\u2019s finished, take a look around at the different folders. There are three folders: <code>src</code>, <code>relay-engine-config</code>, and <code>plugins</code>. The <code>src</code> folder contains the script that acts as the starting point for the entire application, so it includes setup. The <code>relay-engine-config</code> include JSON configuration files that are specific to the <code>SimpleGeneralMessage</code> smart contract. The <code>plugins</code> folder contains the plugin that has logic pertaining to relaying for the <code>SimpleGeneralMessage</code> smart contract.  </p> <p>Before going into detail about how to run anything or how any of the plugin scripts work, you need to understand the different components of the relayer and what the relayer does.</p> <p>The relayer filters and receives VAAs from the guardian network and does \"something\" with it. In this case, the relayer will filter messages approved by the Guardians that originate from your deployed connected contracts, then parse the VAA, then determine its destination, and finally attempt to execute a function called <code>processMyMessage(bytes32 VAA)</code> at the destination. It is important to understand that other relayers from other actors can receive this VAA and that other relayers can execute any VAA in any way they see fit.</p> <p>From a technical standpoint, the implementation of this relayer has four parts.</p> <ol> <li>A non-validating spy node that watches the Wormhole guardian network for all VAAs</li> <li>A component known as a listener, which receives the output of the spy node, filters out which ones are relevant to the relayer, and packages them into workflow objects</li> <li>A Redis database that stores the workflow objects that the listener outputs</li> <li>A component known as an executor, which pops workflows off the database and processes them in some way (in this case, sends a transaction on the destination chain)</li> </ol> <p>Starting from scratch, this can be a lot. Fortunately, Wormhole provides a <code>relayer-engine</code> package to help with the setup.</p> <p>It\u2019s best to tackle the configuration and setup of these four components in order, so start with the spy node. The spy node uses Docker, so ensure that Docker is active before attempting to start the node. The command to start the Docker container is long, so to simplify things, it has been added as an npm script to the repository's parent directory. Just run:</p> <pre><code>npm run testnet-spy\n</code></pre> <p>First, you should see a few logs from the startup of the Docker container. Then, a lot of logs should be spamming the console. These are all the VAAs that are going through the Wormhole TestNet, and there are a lot! Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t have to decipher any of these logs: the code can do that for you.

This file contains plugin code for both the listener and executor components of the relayer, but the comments should make it obvious which functions are relevant to which component. Snippets of the file are shown below and you should be following along, but in case you aren\u2019t, the entire file can be accessed in its GitHub repository.</p> <p>Look at the <code>getFilters()</code> function below. Notice something familiar? The <code>spyServiceFilters</code> object is injected into the plugin class that <code>getFilters()</code> is part of. Note that no filtering is being done, this is only the preparation of the filters. The actual filtering of VAAs occurs within the <code>relayer-engine</code> package, which uses this <code>getFilters()</code> function to understand what to filter.</p> <p>If a developer wanted to add additional logic to the filters, they could here, but for your purposes, simply listing some hard-coded addresses is fine.</p> <pre><code> // How the relayer injects the VAA filters.\n // This is the default implementation provided by the dummy plugin.\n getFilters(): ContractFilter[] {\n   if (this.pluginConfig.spyServiceFilters) {\n     return this.pluginConfig.spyServiceFilters;\n   }\n   this.logger.error('Contract filters not specified in config');\n   throw new Error('Contract filters not specified in config');\n }\n</code></pre> <p>After filtering, the listener needs to write to the Redis database with workflow data in the <code>consumeEvent(vaa, stagingArea)</code> function below.</p> <p>A workflow is just data that the executor needs from the listener to do a proper execution with. In this case, the only information that is being added to the workflow is the time at which the VAA was received and the parsed data in the VAA itself. If a developer wanted to add more relevant information to the workflow, they could do so in the <code>workflowData</code> object.</p> <p>The <code>nextStagingArea</code> object is a way for consumed events (filtered VAAs) to affect each other. For example, if a developer wanted to package two VAAs together into one workflow, they wouldn\u2019t return a <code>workflowData</code> every time.  </p> <pre><code> // Receives VAAs and returns workflows.\n  async consumeEvent(\n    vaa: ParsedVaaWithBytes,\n    stagingArea: StagingAreaKeyLock,\n  ): Promise&lt;\n    | {\n      workflowData: WorkflowPayload;\n      workflowOptions?: WorkflowOptions;\n    }\n    | undefined\n  &gt; {\n    this.logger.debug(`VAA hash: ${vaa.hash.toString('base64')}`);\n\n    return {\n      workflowData: {\n        vaa: vaa.bytes.toString('base64'),\n      },\n    };\n  }\n</code></pre> <p>That\u2019s all that\u2019s necessary for the listener component. Fortunately, most of the code is hidden from the user within the <code>relayer-engine</code> package.</p> <p>If you recall the list of components, the third is the Redis database component. Most of the code that has to do with the database is hidden from the user, since the <code>relayer-engine</code> package will write &amp; read from it, then inject any relevant data back into the plugin code. To run the Redis database, simply run the following command in the parent directory:  </p> <pre><code>npm run redis\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"builders/interoperability/protocols/wormhole/#setting-up-the-executor-component","title":"Setting up the Executor Component","text":"<p>Finally, you must handle the executor component. Recall that the executor component takes workflow data from the Redis database and does some sort of execution action with that data. For most relayers, this execution will involve an on-chain transaction, since a relayer acts as a trustless oracle for VAAs.</p> <p>The <code>relayer-engine</code> package helps handle the wallets for the plugin. Currently, the package only supports Solana and EVM wallets, but with further development more chains will be supported. But it\u2019s not impossible to integrate NEAR or Algorand into the relayer, since you would just have to write your own wallet handling system in addition to the one already provided by the package.</p> <p>To work with the built-in wallet handling system provided by the package, open the file at <code>relayer-engine-config/executor.json.example</code>.

If you haven\u2019t been following along, the entire file can be accessed in its GitHub repository.</p> <p>The <code>handleWorkflow(workflow, providers, execute)</code> function is where all of the logic is, though there are some helper functions underneath it. This is the function that the <code>relayer-engine</code> package invokes when there is a workflow in the Redis database that\u2019s to be used. Notice the three parameters that are injected into the function: <code>workflow</code>, <code>providers</code>, and <code>execute</code>.</p> <ul> <li>The <code>workflow</code> object provides the data that was stored in the database during the listener component\u2019s execution of the <code>consumeEvent(vaa, stagingArea)</code> function. In this case, only the VAA and time it was received was stored in the database, which are stored in the local <code>payload</code> variable</li> <li>The <code>providers</code> object injects Ethers and other chains\u2019 providers, which might be helpful for querying on-chain data or doing other blockchain related actions. As mentioned before, the only providers that are currently supported by the package are Solana and EVMs. The <code>providers</code> object isn\u2019t used in this implementation</li> <li>The <code>execute</code> object currently has two functions in it: <code>onEVM(options)</code> and <code>onSolana(options)</code>. These functions require a Wormhole chain ID and a callback function that has a wallet object injected into it. The wallet included is based off of the private key that was configured in the <code>executor.json</code> file</li> </ul> <p>The first substantial thing this function does is parse the workflow object, then parse its VAA with some helper functions. Afterwards, it takes the parsed VAA payload, converts it into a hexadecimal format, and uses the Ethers utility to ABI-decode the payload into its separate values that were defined way-back-when in the smart contract.</p> <p>With the data that was decoded by Ethers, it\u2019s possible to figure out to which contract and which chain the payload is being sent to, since that data was packaged into the message. The function checks if the specified destination chain ID belongs to an EVM, and will execute using the <code>execute.onEVM(options)</code> function mentioned before. Otherwise, it logs an error since this system doesn\u2019t expect to interact with non-EVM chains for simplicity.</p> <pre><code>// Consumes a workflow for execution\nasync handleWorkflow(\n  workflow: Workflow,\n  providers: Providers,\n  execute: ActionExecutor\n): Promise&lt;void&gt; {\n  this.logger.info(`Workflow ${workflow.id} received...`);\n\n  const { vaa } = this.parseWorkflowPayload(workflow);\n  const parsed = wh.parseVaa(vaa);\n  this.logger.info(`Parsed VAA. seq: ${parsed.sequence}`);\n\n  // Here we are parsing the payload so that we can send it to the right recipient\n  const hexPayload = parsed.payload.toString('hex');\n  let [recipient, destID, sender, message] =\n    ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.decode(\n      ['bytes32', 'uint16', 'bytes32', 'string'],\n      '0x' + hexPayload\n    );\n  recipient = this.formatAddress(recipient);\n  sender = this.formatAddress(sender);\n  const destChainID = destID as ChainId;\n  this.logger.info(\n    `VAA: ${sender} sent \"${message}\" to ${recipient} on chain ${destID}.`\n  );\n\n  // Execution logic\n  if (wh.isEVMChain(destChainID)) {\n    // This is where you do all of the EVM execution.\n    // Add your own private wallet for the executor to inject in \n    // relayer-engine-config/executor.json\n    await execute.onEVM({\n      chainId: destChainID,\n      f: async (wallet, chainId) =&gt; {\n        const contract = new ethers.Contract(recipient, abi, wallet.wallet);\n        const result = await contract.processMyMessage(vaa);\n        this.logger.info(result);\n      },\n    });\n  } else {\n    // The relayer plugin has a built-in Solana wallet handler, which you could use\n    // here.

The ABI that it imports is exported from the <code>SimpleGeneralMessage</code> contract\u2019s compilation, so this code is assuming that the recipient of the message specified in the VAA is or inherits from a <code>SimpleGeneralMessage</code> contract.</p> <p>Then, the code attempts to execute the <code>processMyMessage(bytes32 VAA)</code> function with the VAA, which was previously defined as the function that messages are relayed to. Recall that this function name was arbitrarily chosen for the smart contract because the relayer could specify any function to call. That freedom is expressed in the ability for a developer to change this relayer\u2019s code!</p> <pre><code>await execute.onEVM({\n  chainId: destChainID,\n  f: async (wallet, chainId) =&gt; {\n    const contract = new ethers.Contract(recipient, abi, wallet.wallet);\n    const result = await contract.processMyMessage(vaa);\n    this.logger.info(result);\n  },\n});\n</code></pre> <p>The final piece is to check <code>relayer-engine-config/common.json</code>. This config file controls the execution of the entire relayer. Ensure that the TestNet EVMs that you are using are listed within the <code>supportedChains</code> object of this file. The plugin will not run properly if it\u2019s not listed. If a chain that you are using is not listed, you will have to import the data from Wormhole\u2019s developer documentation into the config file in a format like below.</p> <p>There are also additional configurations for the relayer. For example, the <code>mode</code> string is set to <code>\"BOTH\"</code> to ensure that both the listener and executor plugins are used, but a developer could decide to run only one if they wanted. Additionally, there are multiple log levels to specify, such as <code>\"error\"</code> for just error messages. For this demo, however, just leave the configuration settings as is.</p> <pre><code> \"mode\": \"BOTH\",\n \"logLevel\": \"debug\",\n ...\n    {\n        \"chainId\": 16,\n        \"chainName\": \"Moonbase Alpha\",\n        \"nodeUrl\": \"https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network\",\n        \"bridgeAddress\": \"0xa5B7D85a8f27dd7907dc8FdC21FA5657D5E2F901\",\n        \"tokenBridgeAddress\": \"0xbc976D4b9D57E57c3cA52e1Fd136C45FF7955A96\"\n    },\n</code></pre> <p>That\u2019s it for the configuration!

However, this does not consider the possibility of doing remote calls to Moonbeam's EVM, only to Substrate specific pallets (functionalities).</p> <p>Moonbeam's EVM is only accessible through the Ethereum Pallet. Among many other things, this pallet handles certain validations of transactions before getting them into the transaction pool. Then, it performs another validation step before inserting a transaction from the pool into a block. Lastly, it provides the interface through a <code>transact</code> function to execute a validated transaction. All these steps follow the same behavior as an Ethereum transaction in terms of structure and signature scheme.</p> <p>However, calling the Ethereum Pallet directly through an XCM <code>Transact</code> is not feasible. Mainly because the dispatcher account for the remote EVM call (referred to as <code>msg.sender</code> in  Ethereum) does not sign the XCM transaction on the Moonbeam side. The XCM extrinsic is signed in the origin chain, and the XCM executor dispatches the call, through the <code>Transact</code> instruction, from a known caller linked to the sender in the origin chain. In this context, the Ethereum Pallet will not be able to verify the signature and, ultimately, validate the transaction.</p> <p>To this end, the Ethereum XCM Pallet was introduced. It acts as a middleware between the XCM <code>Transact</code> instruction and the Ethereum Pallet, as special considerations need to be made when performing EVM calls remotely through XCM.

In addition, developers must understand that sending incorrect XCM messages can result in the loss of funds. Consequently, it is essential to test XCM features on a TestNet before moving to a production environment.</p>"},{"location":"builders/interoperability/xcm/remote-execution/remote-evm-calls/#differences-regular-remote-evm","title":"Differences between Regular and Remote EVM Calls through XCM","text":"<p>As explained in the introduction, the paths that regular and remote EVM calls take to get to the EVM are quite different. The main reason behind this difference is the dispatcher of the transaction.</p> <p>A regular EVM call has an apparent sender who signs the Ethereum transaction with its private key. The signature, of ECDSA type, can be verified with the signed message and the <code>r-s</code> values that are produced by the signing algorithm. Ethereum signatures use an additional variable called <code>v</code>, which is the recovery identifier.</p> <p>With remote EVM calls, the signer signs an XCM transaction in another chain. Moonbeam receives that XCM message, which follows the conventional remote execution via XCM form:</p> <ul> <li><code>DescendOrigin</code> (optional)</li> <li><code>WithdrawAsset</code></li> <li><code>BuyExecution</code></li> <li><code>Transact</code></li> </ul> <p>XCM execution happens through a Computed Origin account mechanism, which by default uses the source chain's Sovereign account in the destination chain. If <code>DescendOrigin</code> is included, Moonbeam will mutate the origin of the XCM call to a keyless account that a user from the source chain can control remotely via XCM. The remote EVM call is dispatched from that keyless account (or a related proxy). Therefore, because the transaction is not signed, it does not have the real <code>v-r-s</code> values of the signature, but <code>0x1</code> instead.</p> <p>Since remote EVM calls do not have the actual <code>v-r-s</code> values of the signature, there could be collision problems with the EVM transaction hash, as it is calculated as the keccak256 hash of the signed transaction blob. In consequence, if two accounts with the same nonce submit the same transaction object, they will end up with the same EVM transaction hash. Therefore, all remote EVM transactions use a global nonce that is attached to the Ethereum XCM Pallet.</p> <p>Another significant difference is in terms of the gas price. The fee for remote EVM calls is charged at an XCM execution level. Consequently, the gas price at an EVM level is zero, and the EVM will not charge for the execution itself. This can also be seen in the receipt of a remote EVM call transaction. Accordingly, the XCM message must be configured so that the <code>BuyExecution</code> buys enough weight to cover the gas cost.</p> <p>The last difference is in terms of the gas limit. Ethereum uses a gas-metered system to moderate the amount of execution that can be done in a block. On the contrary, Moonbeam uses a weight-based system in which each call is characterized by the time it takes to execute in a block. Each unit of weight corresponds to one picosecond of execution time.</p> <p>As of runtime 2900, the configuration of the XCM queue suggests that XCM messages should be executable within the following weight units:</p> MoonbeamMoonriverMoonbase Alpha <pre><code>125,000,000,000 (0.125 seconds of block execution time)\n</code></pre> <pre><code>500,000,000,000 (0.5 seconds of block execution time)\n</code></pre> <pre><code>500,000,000,000 (0.5 seconds of block execution time)\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>Prior to runtime 2900, the weight limit of XCM messages across all networks was <code>20,000,000,000</code> weight units (this is, <code>0.02</code> seconds of block execution time).</p> <p>Suppose the XCM message can't be executed due to the lack of execution time in a given block, and the weight requirement exceeds the above limits. In that case, the XCM message will be marked as <code>overweight</code> and only be executable through democracy.</p> <p>The maximum weight limit per XCM message constrains the gas limit available for remote EVM calls through XCM. For all Moonbeam-based networks, there is a ratio of <code>25,000</code> units of gas per unit of weight (<code>WEIGHT_REF_TIME_PER_SECOND</code> / <code>GAS_PER_SECOND</code>). Considering that you need some XCM message weight to execute the XCM instructions, a remote EVM call might consume\u00a02,000,000,000\u00a0units. The following equation can be used to determine the maximum gas units for a remote EVM call:</p> <pre><code>Maximum Gas Units = (Maximum Weight Units - Remote EVM Weight Units) / 25,000\n</code></pre> <p>Therefore, the maximum gas limit you can provide for a remote EVM call can be calculated:</p> MoonbeamMoonriverMoonbase Alpha <pre><code>Maximum Gas Units = (125,000,000,000 - 2,000,000,000) / 25,000\nMaximum Gas Units = 4,920,000\n</code></pre> <pre><code>Maximum Gas Units = (500,000,000,000 - 2,000,000,000) / 25,000\nMaximum Gas Units = 19,920,000\n</code></pre> <pre><code>Maximum Gas Units = (500,000,000,000 - 2,000,000,000) / 25,000\nMaximum Gas Units = 19,920,000\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>These values are subject to change in the future.</p> <p>In summary, these are the main differences between regular and remote EVM calls:</p> <ul> <li>Remote EVM calls use a global nonce (owned by the Ethereum XCM Pallet) instead of a nonce per account</li> <li>The <code>v-r-s</code> values of the signature for remote EVM calls are <code>0x1</code>.

Relative price refers to how many units of the foreign asset correspond to one unit of the native token (GLMR or MOVR) from a value (i.e., price) perspective. For example, if the foreign asset is worth $5 and GLMR is worth $0.25, the relative price would be 0.05. However, we must scale the result to 18 decimals to correspond to the Wei units used.

This weight is needed to execute the four XCM instructions for this remote call in that specific destination chain. Next, you need to find out how much the destination chain charges per weight of XCM execution in reference to the asset's price. Previously, this was done by sourcing a units per second value. However, this method has been replaced by calculating a relative price. Relative price refers to how many units of the foreign asset correspond to one unit of the native token (GLMR or MOVR) from a value (i.e., price) perspective.

Currently, there are two main types of asset transfers using XCM: asset teleporting and remote transfers.</p> <p>Asset teleporting consists of moving an asset from one blockchain to another by destroying the amount being transferred in the origin chain and creating a clone (same amount as destroyed) on the target chain. In such cases, each chain holds the native asset as a reserve, similar to a burn-mint bridging mechanism. The model requires a certain degree of trust, as any of the two chains could maliciously mint more assets.</p> <p>Remote transfers consist of moving an asset from one blockchain to another via an intermediate account in the origin chain that is trustlessly owned by the target chain. This intermediate account is known as the \"Sovereign\" account. In such cases, the origin chain asset is not destroyed but held by the Sovereign account. The XCM execution in the target chain mints a wrapped (also referred to as \"virtual\" or  \"cross-chain\" asset) representation to a target address. The wrapped representation is always interchangeable on a 1:1 basis with the native asset. This is similar to a lock-mint and burn-unlock bridging mechanism.

Substrate's FRAME framework is designed to be flexible and forkless, allowing developers to choose the components that best suit their blockchain needs and perform runtime upgrades without requiring network forks like Ethereum does. Most developers will gravitate towards Substrate with the intention of integrating with the Polkadot ecosystem, but its flexibility allows users to create both solo-chains and parachains.  </p> <p>This page will provide an overview of Polkadot's Substrate and how it relates to the Moonbeam ecosystem. If you're interested in developing on Polkadot yourself with Substrate and FRAME, the Substrate Developer Hub provides comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and examples.</p>"},{"location":"builders/substrate/overview/#substrate-pallets","title":"Substrate Pallets","text":"<p>Pallets are the fundamental building blocks of Substrate blockchains. They are modular components that encapsulate specific functionality. Each pallet is essentially a piece of Rust code that dictates how a particular feature or function operates within the blockchain's runtime.  </p> <p>Pallets are used to customize and extend the capabilities of a Substrate-based blockchain. They can be thought of as plug-and-play modules that can be mixed, matched, and configured to create a bespoke blockchain. Each pallet is independent and designed to do one thing well, providing specific functionality such as managing balances, handling consensus, or facilitating on-chain governance.</p> <p>Some examples of open-source pallets that are available to all Substrate developers are:  </p> <ul> <li>Balances Pallet \u2014 manages the balance of accounts in a Substrate blockchain</li> <li>Assets Pallet \u2014 handles the creation and management of on-chain fungible assets</li> <li>Consensus Pallets \u2014 these pallets provide different consensus mechanisms, such as AURA and BABE, for block production</li> <li>Governance Pallets \u2014 these pallets, like Referenda and Collective, provide on-chain governance mechanisms</li> <li>Frontier Pallets \u2014 Ethereum compatibility layer pallets that allows Substrate-based blockchains to interact with Ethereum-based applications that the Moonbeam team pioneered.

This flexibility is one of the benefits of using Polkadot's Substrate, but it's also important to know that there are a few standards that are enforced across each of the parachains that are connected through the Polkadot relay chain.  </p> <p>The Moonbeam runtime, built with Polkadot's Substrate, can be found in the Moonbeam GitHub repository. Within this repository, you can see additional custom pallets that the Moonbeam team has written and edited within the <code>pallets</code> folder. You can also check out documentation on some Substrate pallets as they pertain to Moonbeam in the Pallets section of our documentation.</p> <p>You can interact with Substrate features exposed by these pallets using development tools like the Polkadot.js API, the Python Substrate Interface, and the Substrate API Sidecar.</p>"},{"location":"builders/substrate/overview/#forkless-upgrades","title":"Forkless Upgrades","text":"<p>One of the best things about developing on Polkadot with Substrate is the ability to introduce forkless upgrades to blockchain runtimes. In traditional blockchain architectures, making substantial changes to the blockchain's rules or logic often requires a hard fork. This process can be disruptive and contentious, potentially splitting the community and the blockchain itself into two separate entities.  </p> <p>Substrate takes a different approach. It separates the blockchain's state (data) from its logic (rules). The logic is contained in the blockchain's runtime, which is itself stored on the blockchain. This design allows the runtime to be upgraded through a special kind of transaction, effectively changing the rules without disrupting the continuity of the blockchain.  </p> <p>Whenever you build a blockchain with Substrate, you compile your Rust code into a build binary. This build can be uploaded into a pre-existing and running blockchain through FRAME's <code>set_code</code> call. When a new runtime is uploaded and approved (typically through an on-chain governance process), all nodes automatically switch to the new runtime at a specified block number. This process is smooth and automatic, with no need for node operators to manually upgrade their software.  </p> <p>Moonbeam regularly uses the forkless upgrade system to add additional features to the Moonbeam ecosystem.

Each parachain is a distinct blockchain with its own runtime and state, but all are connected to and secured by the relay chain. Substrate-based blockchains can become parachains by connecting to the relay chain. Once connected, they can communicate with other parachains through a mechanism known as Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM). This allows them to exchange information and conduct transactions in the same language, enabling a wide range of interoperable applications.  </p> <p>Native interoperability offers the following advantages:  </p> <ul> <li>Shared security \u2014 parachains share the security of the relay chain, reducing the resources each chain needs to secure itself</li> <li>Interchain communication \u2014 parachains can communicate with each other, enabling the transfer of data and assets between different blockchains</li> <li>Asset transfers \u2014 parachains that can communicate with each other can easily send native assets between each other  </li> </ul> <p>By providing native interoperability, Substrate enables the creation of a diverse, interconnected ecosystem of blockchains. This aligns with the vision of a multi-chain future, where different blockchains can work together to provide a richer, more capable blockchain environment.  </p> <p>Moonbeam's networks have a series of XCM connections with many other parachains.

This example will create the call from Alice's account. As such, Alice will need to submit a deposit. The deposit is calculated as follows:</p> <pre><code>Deposit = depositBase + threshold * depositFactor\n</code></pre> <p>You can retrieve the <code>depositBase</code> and <code>depositFactor</code> using the getter functions for the Pallet Constants.</p> <p>Once the call is approved and dispatched or cancelled the deposit will be returned to Alice.</p> <p>Since there is a threshold of two for this multisig, at least Bob or Charlie will need to approve the call if not both of them. The last account to approve the call will also need to dispatch the call. Dispatching the call is done automatically when the <code>asMulti</code> function is used to approve the call.</p> <p>With the basics out of the way, you can begin to create a multisig call. For this example, you can create a call that will transfer 0.1 DEV from the ABC multisig account to Charlie's account. First, you'll need to get the encoded call data for the transfer. Go ahead and navigate to the Extrinsics page on Polkadot.js Apps and take the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>Make sure an account is selected. It doesn't have to be the ABC multisig account, as the selected account is not included in the encoded call data</li> <li>Select the balances pallet and the transfer extrinsic</li> <li>Set Charlie as the dest account</li> <li>Enter the amount to transfer, which is <code>0.1</code> DEV for this example</li> <li>Click the copy button next to the encoded call data</li> <li>Click the copy button next to the encoded call hash. Please note that you do not have to submit the extrinsic, you only need the encoded call data and the encoded call hash</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Make sure you've copied and saved the encoded call data and the encoded call hash as you'll need them both to approve the multisig call later on in the tutorial. For this example, the encoded call data and hash are as follows:</p> Encoded call dataEncoded call hash <pre><code>0x0300798d4ba9baf0064ec19eb4f0a1a45785ae9d6dfc1300008a5d78456301\n</code></pre> <pre><code>0x76d1a0a8f6eb177dd7a561ef954e83893823fa5d77f576910f3fdc6cb4666dea\n</code></pre> <p>Next, you can create the multisig call by using the <code>asMulti</code> extrinsic, you'll take the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>Select the account you want to create the call with. For this example, Alice is used</li> <li>Select the multisig pallet and the asMulti extrinsic</li> <li>Set the threshold of the multisig to the same value as you initially set from the Accounts page, which should be <code>2</code></li> <li>Add the other accounts that are associated with the multisig: Bob and Charlie</li> <li>Since this is the first transaction to create the multisig call, make sure the include option slider is toggled off for the maybeTimepoint field. You would only enter this information for approvals that rely on knowing the timepoint at which the call was created</li> <li>Provide the call information for the balance transfer similarly to how you did it in the previous set of steps. Select the balances pallet and the transfer extrinsic</li> <li>Set the dest account to Charlie</li> <li>Set the value to <code>0.1</code> DEV tokens</li> <li>You can leave the refTime and proofSize fields set to <code>0</code></li> <li>Click Submit Transaction to create the multisig call</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Now that you've created the multisig call, you can submit approval transactions from either Bob's or Charlie's account, or both. Remember, for the call to be approved and dispatched, you need to have at least two of three members of the multisig to approve it. Since Alice created the multisig call, that means she has already automatically approved it.</p> <p>You can easily approve the transactions through the Accounts page of Polkadot.js Apps. Next to your multisig account, you'll notice there is a multisig icon there that you can hover over. Once you hover over it, you'll be able to click on View pending approvals.</p> <p></p> <p>The pending call hashes pop-up will appear where you can follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Since you should only have one hash at this point, you can select it from this list. If you have multiple hashes, you can compare the hashes in the list with the encoded call hash you copied earlier on in this section</li> <li>The depositor should be automatically populated. For this example, it should be Alice</li> <li>For the approval type, you can choose to either approve or reject the call. For this example, you can select Approve this call hash</li> <li>Choose the account you want to approve the transaction from. This example uses Bob's account</li> <li>Click Approve to submit the approval transaction. Under the hood, this uses the <code>approveAsMulti</code> extrinsic of the Multisig Pallet</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>So far, Alice and Bob have approved the multisig call, which means the threshold has been met. However, the call has not been dispatched yet since you have not yet submitted an executing approval. To do so, you'll take the same steps as above plus these additional steps:</p> <ol> <li>Select the account you want to approve the transaction from. This example uses Charlie's account</li> <li>Toggle the multisig message with call (for final approval) switch to on. Under the hood, this switches the extrinsic to <code>asMulti</code>, which automatically approves and dispatches the call if the threshold for approvals has been met as is the case at this point</li> <li>The call data for final approval field will appear. Enter the encoded call data that you copied earlier on in this section</li> <li>Click Approve to submit the approval, which will also dispatch the multisig call</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Once the final transaction has been submitted, 0.1 DEV tokens will be transferred from the ABC multisig account to Charlie's account and the multisig deposit will be returned to Alice's account. And that's it! You've successfully created a multisig call, approved the call, and dispatched it.</p>"},{"location":"builders/substrate/interfaces/account/proxy/","title":"The Proxy Pallet","text":""},{"location":"builders/substrate/interfaces/account/proxy/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Proxy accounts can be set up to perform a limited number of actions on behalf of users and are useful for keeping the underlying accounts safe.

As blocks are created, nodes in the network must decide which block will represent the next valid state. Finality defines when that valid state cannot be altered or reversed.</p> <p>Ethereum began by using a consensus protocol based on Proof-of-Work (PoW), which provides probabilistic finality. However, in 2022, Ethereum switched to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), which provides deterministic finality, and no longer uses PoW. In contrast, Moonbeam uses a hybrid consensus protocol based on Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), which also provides deterministic finality. DPoS is an evolution of Polkadot's Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) concept, that puts more power into the hands of token holders by allowing delegators to choose which collator candidate they want to support and in what magnitude.</p> <p>This guide will outline some of these main differences around consensus and finality, and what to expect when using Moonbeam for the first time.</p>"},{"location":"learn/core-concepts/consensus-finality/#ethereum-consensus-and-finality","title":"Ethereum Consensus and Finality","text":"<p>As stated before, Ethereum is currently using a PoS consensus protocol, in which validators stake ETH in the network and are responsible for producing blocks and checking the validity of new blocks. The timing of block production is fixed and is divided into 12 second slots and 32 slot epochs. One validator per slot is randomly selected to produce a block and broadcast it to the network. There is a randomly selected committee of validators per slot that is responsible for determining the validity of the block. The greater the stake in the network, the greater the chance the validator will be chosen to produce or validate a block.</p> <p>Finality is deterministic in Ethereum's PoS consensus protocol and is achieved through \"checkpoint\" blocks. Validators agree on the state of a block at particular checkpoint blocks, which are always the first block in an epoch, and if two-thirds of the validators agree, the block is finalized. Block finality can be reverted; however, there are strong economic incentives in place so validators do not attempt to collude to revert a block. You can find out more information in Vitalik's On Settlement Finality blog, under the Finality in Casper section.</p>"},{"location":"learn/core-concepts/consensus-finality/#moonbeam-consensus-and-finality","title":"Moonbeam Consensus and Finality","text":"<p>In Polkadot, there are collators and validators.

GRANDPA provides deterministic finality for any given transaction (block). In other words, when a block or transaction is marked as final, it can't be reverted except via on-chain governance or forking. Moonbeam follows this deterministic finality.</p>"},{"location":"learn/core-concepts/consensus-finality/#main-differences","title":"Main Differences Between PoS and DPoS","text":"<p>In terms of consensus, Moonbeam is based on Delegated Proof-of-Stake, while Ethereum relies on a standard Proof-of-Stake system, which is slightly different. Although both mechanisms rely on the use of stake to validate and create new blocks, there are some key differences.</p> <p>With PoS on Ethereum, validators are selected to produce and validate blocks based on their own stake in the network. As long as a validator has placed a validator deposit, they can be selected to produce and validate blocks. However, as previously mentioned, the greater the stake in the network, the higher the chances a validator has to be selected to produce and validate blocks.</p> <p>On the other hand, with DPoS on Moonbeam, collators become eligible to produce blocks based on their own stake plus their delegated stake in the network. Any token holder can choose to delegate their stake to a collator candidate. The top collator candidates by stake, including delegations, join the active set. The number of candidates in the active set is subject to governance. Once in the active set, collators are randomly selected to produce blocks using the Nimbus Consensus Framework. It is important to note that once a collator is in the active set, their total stake does not impact their chances of being selected to produce blocks.</p> <p>In terms of finality, blocks on Ethereum can take quite a bit longer to finalize than on Moonbeam due to the checkpoint finality system it uses. In Ethereum, validators determine finality at checkpoint blocks, which are always the first block in an epoch. Since an epoch has 32 slots and each slot is 12 seconds, it'll take at least 384 seconds, or 6.4 minutes for a block to be finalized.</p> <p>Moonbeam does not use checkpoint blocks and instead relies on Polkadot's GRANDPA finality gadget, where the finality process is completed in parallel to block production. In addition, the finality process incorporates the blockchain's structure, which allows the relay chain validators to vote on the highest block that they think is valid. In this scenario, the vote would apply to all of the blocks leading up to the one that is finalized, which speeds up the finalization process. After a block has been included in the relay chain, a block can be finalized within one block on Moonbeam.</p>"},{"location":"learn/core-concepts/consensus-finality/#check-tx-finality-with-ethereum-rpc-endpoints","title":"Check Transaction Finality with Ethereum RPC Endpoints","text":"<p>Although the finality gadgets differ, you can use the same, fairly simple strategy to check for transaction finality on both Ethereum and Moonbeam:</p> <ol> <li>You ask the network for the hash of the latest finalized block</li> <li>You retrieve the block number using the hash</li> <li>You compare it with the block number of your transaction.

The <code>call()</code> function is made available through the address data type in Solidity. When the <code>call()</code> function is invoked, the target contract is called using the arbitrary call data.</p> <p>Arbitrary code execution follows the pattern in the diagram below when Contract A allows a user to influence its call to Contract B.</p> <p></p> <p>As previously mentioned, one major concern of arbitrarily executing code on Moonbeam is that Moonbeam has precompile contracts that can be called, which can be used to get around some protections that are typically available on Ethereum. To safely use arbitrary code execution on Moonbeam, you should consider the following, which only applies to contracts that allow arbitrary code execution:</p> <ul> <li>Moonbeam precompiled contracts such as the Native ERC-20 precompile, XC-20 precompiles, and XCM-related precompiles allow users to manage and transfer assets without requiring access to the EVM. Instead, these actions are done using native Substrate code.

Providing whitelisted target contracts in the function that executes the arbitrary call data is considered safe, assuming that the contracts being called are not precompiles, or that in the case they are, the contract making the call does not hold the native token or any XC-20</li> </ul> <p>In the following sections, you'll learn about each of these security considerations through examples.</p>"},{"location":"learn/core-concepts/security/#setting-a-value","title":"Precompiles Can Override a Set Value","text":"<p>On Ethereum, a smart contract that allows for arbitrary code execution could force the value of a call to be a specific amount (for example, <code>{value: 0}</code>), guaranteeing that only that amount of native currency would be sent with the transaction. Whereas on Moonbeam, the native ERC-20 precompile contract enables you to interact with the native currency on Moonbeam as an ERC-20 through the Substrate API. As a result, you can transfer the Moonbeam native asset from a smart contract by setting the <code>value</code> of a call, as well as through the native ERC-20 precompile. If you set the <code>value</code> of an arbitrary call, it can be overridden by targeting the native ERC-20 precompile contract and passing in call data to transfer the native asset. Since ERC-20s and XC-20s are not native assets, setting the value attribute doesn't provide any protection for these types of assets on Ethereum or Moonbeam.</p> <p>For example, if you have a contract that allows arbitrary code execution and you pass it encoded call data that transfers the balance of a contract to another address, you could essentially drain the given contract of it's balance.</p> <p>To get the encoded call data, you can use any of the ABI encoding functions outlined in the Solidity docs, including <code>abi.encodeWithSelector</code> as seen in the following function:</p> <pre><code>function getBytes(address _erc20Contract, address _arbitraryCallContract, address _to) public view returns (bytes memory) {\n    // Load ERC-20 interface of contract\n    IERC20 erc20 = IERC20(_erc20Contract);\n    // Get amount to transfer\n    uint256 amount = erc20.balanceOf(_arbitraryCallContract);\n    // Build the encoded call data\n    return abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transfer.selector, _to, amount);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Once you have the encoded call data, you could make an arbitrary call to the native ERC-20 precompile contract, set the value of the call to <code>0</code>, and pass in the call data in bytes:</p> <pre><code>function makeArbitraryCall(address _target, bytes calldata _bytes) public {\n    // Value: 0 does not protect against native ERC-20 precompile calls or XCM precompiles\n    (bool success,) = _target.call{value: 0}(_bytes);\n    require(success);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The value of <code>0</code> will be overridden by the amount to be transferred as specified in the encoded call data, which in this example is the balance of the contract.</p>"},{"location":"learn/core-concepts/security/#whitelisting-function-selectors","title":"Whitelisting Safe Function Selectors","text":"<p>By whitelisting a specific function selector, you can control what functions can be executed and ensure only functions that are considered safe and do not call precompiles are allowed to be called.</p> <p>To get the function selector to whitelist, you can keccack256 hash the signature of the function.</p> <p>Once you have the whitelisted function selector, you can use inline assembly to get the function selector from the encoded call data and compare the two selectors using the require function.

The <code>MaxFeePerGas</code> defines the maximum fee permitted to be paid per unit of gas and is the sum of the <code>BaseFee</code> and the <code>MaxPriorityFeePerGas</code>. The <code>MaxPriorityFeePerGas</code> is the maximum priority fee configured by the sender of a transaction that is used to incentivize the prioritization of a transaction in a block.</p> <p>Although Moonbeam is Ethereum-compatible, it is also a Substrate-based chain at its core, and priorities work differently in Substrate than in Ethereum. In Substrate, transactions are not prioritized by gas price. To address this, Moonbeam uses a modified prioritization system that reprioritizes Substrate transactions using an Ethereum-first solution. A Substrate transaction still goes through the validity process, where it is assigned transaction tags, longevity, and a priority. The original priority is then overwritten with a new priority based on the transaction's fee per gas, which is derived from the transaction's tip and weight. If the transaction is an Ethereum transaction, the priority is set according to the priority fee.</p> <p>It's important to note that priority is not the sole component responsible for determining the order of transactions in a block.

As a result, you can interact with your Moonbeam account using MetaMask and Ethereum tools you may already be familiar with, such as Remix and Hardhat.</p> <p>You can also interact with your Moonbeam account using Polkadot.js Apps as it natively supports H160 addresses and ECDSA keys. For more information on this integration, you can check out the Interacting with Moonbeam Using Polkadot.js Apps guide.</p>"},{"location":"learn/core-concepts/unified-accounts/#substrate-evm-compatible-blockchain","title":"Substrate EVM Compatible Blockchain","text":"<p>Any parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem can offer a full EVM implementation, which provides the possibility of executing Solidity-based smart contracts with minimal to no changes. Substrate makes this integration possible - just plug the EVM pallet into your runtime for EVM support, and the Ethereum Pallet with Frontier to have Ethereum RPC compatibility. The availability of these open-source modules that Moonbeam has developed with Parity has led multiple parachains to offer Ethereum compatibility on their chains.</p> <p>But there is an important catch. With the configuration described above, a user, for example, Alice, can have an Ethereum-style address (H160 format), which is 40+2 hex-characters long, in a Substrate based chain. This address matches a private key, which can be used to sign transactions in the Ethereum side of the chain. Furthermore, the address is mapped into a storage slot inside the Substrate Balance pallet to a Substrate-style address (H256 format).</p> <p>However, Alice only knows the private key of the H160 address, and not of the mapped version. Therefore, she is unable to send transactions with her H256 address and is limited only to do read-only operations through Substrate\u2019s API. As a consequence, Alice needs another H256 address matching a different private key to be able to operate in the Substrate side of the chain, which include, among others, staking, balances, and governance.</p> <p>The following diagram illustrates this configuration.</p> <p></p> <p>This can creates friction and a poor user experience for Alice. First, she has to move tokens to her H160 mapped H256 address to be able to make transactions and deploy contracts through the EVM. Second, she also needs to hold a balance in her other H256 address (which she has a different private key for) to use Substrate-based features. So in short, Alice needs a minimum of two private keys to have the best of both worlds.</p>"},{"location":"learn/core-concepts/unified-accounts/#moonbeam-unified-accounts","title":"Moonbeam Unified Accounts","text":"<p>Moonbeam\u2019s focus is to create a fully Ethereum-compatible environment on Polkadot with the best user experience possible.

Players and collectors can hunt or battle for a chance to capture these unique monsters and to earn coins.\",\n            \"id\":\"blockchain-monster-hunt\",\n            \"tags\":[\n                \"NFT\",\n                \"Gaming\",\n                \"GLMR Grants\"\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"urls\":{\n                \"website\":\"https://speedboat.studio/\",\n                \"try\":\"https://speedboat.studio/\",\n                \"twitter\":\"https://twitter.com/Speedboat_STDO\",\n                \"medium\":\"https://medium.com/@speedboat_studio\",\n                \"discord\":\"https://discord.gg/y7TQbtEWSV\"\n            },\n            \"slug\":\"speedboat.studio\",\n            \"createdAt\":1699292616328,\n            \"logo\":{\n                \"small\":{\n                    \"width\":36,\n                    \"fileName\":\"speedboat.studio-logo-small.png\",\n                    \"mimeType\":\"image/png\",\n                    \"height\":36\n                },\n                \"large\":{\n                    \"width\":190,\n                    \"fileName\":\"speedboat.studio-logo-large.png\",\n                    \"mimeType\":\"image/png\",\n                    \"height\":190\n                },\n                \"full\":{\n                    \"width\":3000,\n                    \"fileName\":\"speedboat.studio-logo-full.png\",\n                    \"mimeType\":\"image/png\",\n                    \"height\":3000\n                }\n            },\n            \"name\":\"Speedboat\",\n            \"chains\":[\n                \"moonbeam\"\n            ],\n            \"defiLLamaTvlExist\":false,\n            \"projectCreationDate\":1657584952000,\n            \"shortDescription\":\"Your no-code Web3 toolkit\",\n            \"contracts\":[\n\n            ],\n            \"updatedAt\":1722498916466,\n            \"category\":\"nfts\",\n            \"description\":\"Speedboat is a Web3 toolkit for everyone.

In the middle of their voyage they encountered a fearsome maelstrom. The Captain and his crew worked tirelessly to keep the ship afloat. Badly damaged, the Ship limped to the edges of the storm. It was taking on water and the cries of terrified children could be heard above the crashing waves. Another ship appeared on the horizon, it\u2019s light glowing brightly against the dark night. The Captain of the Fortune\u2019s Grasp ordered his crew to evacuate the families, but the fifty crew members ignored the Captain, abandoning ship, taking all means of escape with them. The Captain, left on the sinking ship, cursed the cowardly crew for damning those innocent souls to the watery depths. Those Forsaken Fifty were marked with The Black Spot, doomed to row the high seas until the Reaper came to claim his mutinous crew to serve on the Ship Of The Damned. However, if they could convince another soul to take their place at the oars, protection would be offered by those Pirates who\u2019ve cheated the Reaper before. Those who\u2019ve served and survived are welcome in the Damned Pirates Society.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Damned Pirate Society is an Profile Picture NFT with inbuilt utility.

In such a scheme, the block finality gadget and the block production mechanism are separate. Consequently, parachains only have to worry about producing blocks and rely on the relay chain to validate the state transitions.</p> <p>At a parachain level, block producers are called collators. They maintain parachains (such as Moonbeam) by collecting transactions from users and offering blocks to the relay chain validators.</p> <p>However, parachains might find the following problems they need to solve in a trustless and decentralized matter (if applicable):</p> <ul> <li>Amongst all of the nodes in the network, which ones are allowed to author blocks?</li> <li>If multiple nodes are allowed, will they be eligible at the same time? Only one? Maybe a few?</li> </ul> <p>Enter Nimbus. Nimbus is a framework for building slot-based consensus algorithms on Cumulus-based parachains. It strives to provide standard implementations for the logistical parts of such consensus engines and helpful traits for implementing the elements (filters) that researchers and developers want to customize. These filters can be customizable to define what a block authorship slot is and can be composed, so block authorship is restricted to a subset of collators in multiple steps.</p> <p>For example, Moonbeam uses a two-layer approach. The first layer comprises the parachain staking filter, which helps select an active collator pool among all collator candidates using a staked-based ranking. The second layer adds another filter which narrows down the number of collators to a subset for each slot.</p> <p>Notice that Nimbus can only answer which collator(s) are eligible to produce a parachain block in the next available slot. It is the Cumulus consensus mechanism that marks this parachain block as best, and ultimately the BABE and GRANDPA hybrid consensus model (of the relay chain) that will include this parachain block in the relay chain and finalize it. Once any relay chain forks are resolved at a relay chain level, that parachain block is deterministically finalized.</p> <p>The following two sections go over the filtering strategy currently used on Moonbeam.</p>"},{"location":"learn/features/consensus/#parachain-staking-filtering","title":"Parachain Staking Filtering","text":"<p>Collators can join the candidate pool by simply bonding some tokens via an extrinsic. Once in the pool, token holders can add to the candidate's stake via delegation (also referred to as staking), that is, at a parachain level.</p> <p>Parachain staking is the first of the two Nimbus filters applied to the candidate pool. It selects the top 36 candidates in terms of tokens staked in the network, which includes the candidate's bond and delegations from token holders. This filtered pool is called selected candidates, and selected candidates are renewed every round (which lasts 1200 blocks). For a given round, the following diagram describes the parachain staking filtering:</p> <p></p> <p>From this pool, another filter is applied to retrieve a subset of eligible candidates for the next block authoring slot.</p> <p>If you want to learn more about staking, visit our staking documentation.</p>"},{"location":"learn/features/consensus/#fixed-size-subset-filtering","title":"Fixed Size Subset Filtering","text":"<p>Once the parachain staking filter is applied and the selected candidates are retrieved, a second filter is applied on a block by block basis and helps narrow down the selected candidates to a smaller number of eligible collators for the next block authoring slot.</p> <p>In broad terms, this second filter picks a pseudo-random subset of the previously selected candidates. The eligibility ratio, a tunable parameter, defines the size of this subset.</p> <p>A high eligibility ratio results in fewer chances for the network to skip a block production slot, as more collators will be eligible to propose a block for a specific slot. However, only a certain number of validators are assigned to a parachain, meaning that most of these blocks will not be backed by a validator. For those that are, a higher number of backed blocks means that it might take longer for the relay chain to solve any possible forks and return a finalized block. Moreover, this might create an unfair advantage for certain collators that might be able to get their proposed block faster to relay chain validators, securing a higher portion of block rewards (if any).</p> <p>A lower eligibility ratio might provide faster block finalization times and a fairer block production distribution amongst collators. However, if the eligible collators are not able to propose a block (for whatever reason), the network will skip a block, affecting its stability.</p> <p>Once the size of the subset is defined, collators are randomly selected using a source of entropy. Currently, an internal coin-flipping algorithm is implemented, but this will later be migrated to use the relay chain's randomness beacon. Consequently, a new subset of eligible collators is selected for every relay chain block. For a given round and a given block <code>XYZ</code>, the following diagram describes the fixed-size subset filtering:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"learn/features/consensus/#why-nimbus","title":"Why Nimbus?","text":"<p>You might ask yourself: but why Nimbus?

At first glance, you might think this adds a higher execution load to a single block compared to doing this check off-chain. But consider this from a validator\u2019s perspective</p> <p>The validators will also have to check the author. By putting the author-checking execution logic in a pallet, the execution time can be benchmarked and quantified with weights. If this execution time is not accounted for, there is the risk of a block exceeding the relay chain Wasm execution limit (currently 0.5 seconds).</p> <p>In practice, this check will be fast and will most likely not push execution time over the limit. But from a theoretical perspective, accounting for its weight is better for implementation purposes.</p>"},{"location":"learn/features/consensus/#reusability","title":"Reusability","text":"<p>Another benefit of moving the author-checking execution to a pallet, rather than a custom executor, is that one single executor can be reused for any consensus that can be expressed in the Nimbus framework.

A GMP provider listens for specific events on the origin blockchain pertaining to their gateway or mailbox contracts that indicate that a user wants to send a cross-chain message using their protocol. The GMP provider will validate certain parameters, including whether or not sufficient value was provided to pay for gas on the destination chain. In fact, the GMP provider may have a decentralized network of many nodes checking the authenticity of the message and verifying parameters.

Moonbeam is a single shard, so cross-contract calls have the same synchronous execution semantics as on Ethereum Layer 1.</p> <p></p> <p>A high-level interaction flow is shown above. A Web3 RPC call from a DApp or existing Ethereum developer tool, such as Hardhat, is received by a Moonbeam node. The node has both Web3 RPCs and Substrate RPCs available, meaning you can use Ethereum or Substrate tools when interacting with a Moonbeam node. These RPC calls are handled by associated Substrate runtime functions. The Substrate runtime checks signatures and handles any extrinsics. Smart contract calls are ultimately passed to the EVM to execute the state transitions.</p>"},{"location":"learn/platform/technology/#ethereum-pallet","title":"Ethereum Pallet","text":"<p>The Ethereum pallet is responsible for handling blocks and transaction receipts and statuses. It enables sending and receiving Ethereum-formatted data to and from Moonbeam by storing an Ethereum-style block and its associated transaction hashes in the Substrate runtime.</p> <p>When a user submits a raw Ethereum transaction, it converts into a Substrate transaction through the pallet Ethereum's <code>transact</code> extrinsic. Using the Ethereum pallet as the sole executor of the EVM pallet forces all of the data to be stored and transacted in an Ethereum-compatible way. This enables block explorers such as Moonscan, which is built by Etherscan, to be able to index block data.</p> <p>Along with support for Ethereum-style data, the Ethereum pallet combined with the RPC module provides RPC support. This enables usage of basic Ethereum JSON-RPC methods, which ultimately allows existing Ethereum DApps to be deployed to Moonbeam with minimal changes.</p>"},{"location":"learn/platform/technology/#evm-pallet","title":"EVM Pallet","text":"<p>The EVM pallet implements a sandboxed virtual stack machine and uses the SputnikVM as the underlying EVM engine.</p> <p>The EVM executes Ethereum smart contract bytecode, typically written in a language like Solidity, and then compiles it to EVM bytecode. The EVM pallet aims to emulate the functionality of executing smart contracts on Ethereum within the Substrate runtime. As such, it allows existing EVM code to be executed in Substrate-based blockchains.</p> <p>Inside the EVM are standard H160 Ethereum-style accounts, with associated data such as the balance and nonce. All of the accounts in the EVM are backed by a configurable Substrate account type. Moonbeam has configured the Substrate account type to be a non-standard H160 account fully compatible with Ethereum. So, you only need a single account to interact with the Substrate runtime and the EVM. For more information on Moonbeam's account system, please refer to the Unified Accounts page.</p> <p>With a unified accounts system, a mapped Substrate account can call the EVM pallet to deposit or withdraw balance from the Substrate-base currency into a different balance managed and used by the EVM pallet. Once a balance exists, smart contracts can be created and interacted with.</p> <p>The EVM pallet can also be configured so that no dispatchable calls can cause EVM execution, with the exception being from other pallets in the runtime. Moonbeam is configured this way, with the Ethereum pallet having sole responsibility for EVM execution. Using the Ethereum pallet enables EVM interactions through the Ethereum API.</p> <p>If a blockchain doesn't need Ethereum emulation and only needs EVM execution, Substrate uses its account model fully and signs transactions on behalf of EVM accounts. However, Ethereum RPCs are unavailable in this model, and DApps must write their frontend using the Substrate API.</p> <p>The EVM pallet should produce nearly identical execution results to Ethereum, such as gas cost and balance changes. However, there are some differences. Please refer to the EVM module vs Ethereum network section of the Frontier EVM Pallet documentation for more information.</p> <p>There are also some precompiles that can be used alongside the EVM pallet that extends the functionality of the EVM.

Join the server and introduce yourself even before you need help. Send gilmouta or artkaseman a DM and let them know who you are, and they can reach out to you if they see any issues with your node.</p> <p>Q: How do I stay up to date?</p> <p>A: All upgrades and important technical information are announced on Discord, in the #tech-upgrades-announcements channel. Join and follow this channel. You can set up integrations to Slack or Telegram if those are your preferred communication channels.</p> <p>Q: How do I register my node?</p> <p>A: There is a questionnaire, in which you will be able to provide your contact information as well as some basic hardware specs. You must be running a collator node on Moonbase Alpha to fill out the questionnaire.</p> <p>Q: What are the hardware requirements?</p> <p>A: Running a collator requires top of the line hardware to be able to process transactions and maximize your rewards. This is a very important factor in block production and rewards.</p> <p>Run a systemd service on a top of the line bare-metal machine (i.e. run a physical server, not a cloud VM, or a docker container). You can run your own, or select a provider to manage the server for you.</p> <p>Run only one service at a time per bare-metal machine. Do not run multiple instances.</p> <p>Q: What is the recommended hardware to run a collator?</p> <p>A:</p> <p>Hardware recommendations:</p> <ul> <li>Top of the line CPU:<ul> <li>Ryzen 9 5950x or 5900x</li> <li>Intel Xeon E-2386 or E-2388</li> </ul> </li> <li>Primary and backup bare metal servers in different data centers and countries (Hetzner is OK for one of them)</li> <li>Dedicated server for Moonbeam that isn't shared with any other apps</li> <li>1 TB NVMe HDD</li> <li>32 GB RAM</li> </ul> <p>Q: What about backup nodes?</p> <p>A: Run two bare-metal machines of the same specifications, in different countries and service providers. If your primary fails you can quickly resume services on your backup and continue to produce blocks and earn rewards. Please refer to the Q&amp;A on failovers below.</p> <p>Q: What are the different networks?</p> <p>A: There are three networks, each will require dedicated hardware. The Moonbase Alpha TestNet is free and should be used to familiarize yourself with the setup.</p> <ul> <li>Moonbeam - production network on Polkadot</li> <li>Moonriver - production network on Kusama</li> <li>Moonbase Alpha TestNet - development network</li> </ul> <p>Q: What ports do I allow on my firewall?</p> <p>A:</p> <ul> <li>Allow all incoming requests on TCP ports 30333 and 30334</li> <li>Allow requests from your management IPs on TCP port 22</li> <li>Drop all other ports</li> </ul> <p>Q: Is there a CPU optimized binary?</p> <p>A: On each release page are CPU optimized binaries. Select the binary for your CPU architecture.</p> <ul> <li>Moonbeam-znver3 - Ryzen 9</li> <li>Moonbeam-skylake - Intel</li> <li>Moonbeam - generic can be used for all others</li> </ul> <p>Q: What are the recommendations on monitoring my node?</p> <p>A: Monitoring is very important for the health of the network and to maximize your rewards. We recommend using Grafana Labs. They have a free tier which should handle 6+ moonbeam servers.</p> <p>Q: What are the KPIs I should be monitoring?</p> <p>A: The main key performance indicator is blocks produced. The prometheus metric for this is called <code>substrate_proposer_block_constructed_count</code>.  </p> <p>Q: How should I setup alerting?</p> <p>A: Alerting is critical to keeping your moonbeam node producing blocks and earning rewards. We recommend pagerduty.com, which is supported by Grafana Labs. Use the KPI query above and set an alert when this drops below 1. The alert should page the person on-call 24/7.  </p> <p>Q: What are Nimbus keys?</p> <p>A: Nimbus keys are just like session keys in Polkadot. You should have unique keys on your primary and backup servers. Save the key output somewhere safe where you can access it in the middle of the night if you receive an alert. To create your keys, please refer to the Session Keys section of the documentation.</p> <p>Q: What is the failover process if my primary node is down?</p> <p>A: When the primary server is down, the best way to perform a failover to the backup server is to perform a key association update. Each server should have a unique set of keys already. Run the <code>setKeys</code> author mapping extrinsic. You can follow the Mapping Extrinsic instructions and modify the instructions to use the <code>setKeys</code> extrinsic.</p> <p>Q: Should I set up centralized logging?</p> <p>A: Grafana Labs can also be configured for centralized logging and is recommended. You can see all your nodes in one place. Kibana has a more robust centralized logging offering, but Grafana is simple and good enough to start.</p> <p>Q: What should I look for in the logs?</p> <p>A: Logs are very useful to determine if you are in sync and ready to join the collators pool. Look at the tail end of the logs to determine if:</p> <ol> <li>Your Relay chain is in sync</li> <li>Your parachain is in sync</li> </ol> <p>You should see Idle in your logs when your node is in sync.</p> <p></p> <p>A common issue is joining the pool before your node is in sync. You will be unable to produce any blocks or receive any rewards. Wait until you are in sync and idle before joining the candidate pool.</p> <p></p> <p>The relay chain takes much longer to sync than the parachain. You will not see any finalized blocks until the relay chain has synced.</p> <p>Q: How much is the bond to become a collator?</p> <p>A: There are two bonds you need to be aware of. Make sure your node is configured and in sync before proceeding with these steps.</p> <p>The first is the bond to join the collators pool:</p> <ul> <li>Moonbeam - minimum of 2000000 GLMR</li> <li>Moonriver - minimum of 500 MOVR</li> <li>Moonbase Alpha - minimum of 500 DEV</li> </ul> <p>The second is the bond for key association:</p> <ul> <li>Moonbeam - minimum of 10000 GLMR</li> <li>Moonriver - minimum of 100 MOVR</li> <li>Moonbase Alpha - minimum of 100 DEV</li> </ul> <p>Q: How do I set an identity on my collator account? </p> <p>A: Setting an identity on chain will help to identify your node and attract delegations. You can set an identity by following the instructions on the Managing an Identity page of our documentation.</p>"},{"location":"node-operators/networks/collators/orbiter/","title":"Moonbeam Orbiter Program","text":""},{"location":"node-operators/networks/collators/orbiter/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>The Moonbeam Foundation is announcing a limited trial of the orbiter program.

You'll need to use the credentials from the <code>.api</code> file</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Go to the Configuration Page and copy the node address</p> </li> <li> <p>Fund the node.

Based on geographical location, Onramp displays relevant bank account details and available payment methods. Once payment is completed through the selected method, Onramp handles all aspects of the conversion - from payment processing to regulatory compliance and wallet management. Upon confirmation of the deposit, the platform automatically purchases GLMR at the current market price and then initiates an automatic withdrawal to the specified Moonbeam wallet address.

When they do so, they are vouching for that specific candidate, and their delegation is a signal of trust. When delegating, tokens are deducted instantly and added to the total amount staked by the user. Exiting a position is divided into a two step operation: scheduling and execution. First, token holders must schedule a request to exit their position, and wait for a given delay or unbonding period, which depends on the network. Once the unbonding period has expired, users can execute their scheduled action.</p> <p>Once a candidate joins the active set of collators, they are eligible to produce blocks and receive partial block rewards as part of the token inflationary model. They share these as staking rewards with their delegators, considering their proportional contribution toward their stake in the network. Delegators can choose to auto-compound their rewards so that a set percentage of their rewards are automatically applied to their total delegation amount.</p> <p>This guide will show you how to stake on Moonbase Alpha via Polkadot.js Apps, but similar steps can be taken for any of the Moonbeam and Moonriver.

When a smart contract is given approval to access a user's tokens, the amount of tokens it has access to is often an unlimited amount, depending on the DApp.</p> <p>One of the reasons why many DApps use an unlimited amount is so that users don't need to continue to sign approval transactions every time they want to move their tokens. This is in addition to the second transaction required to actually swap the tokens. For networks like Ethereum, this can be expensive. However, if the approved smart contract has a vulnerability, it could be exploited and the users' tokens could be transferred at any time without requiring further approval. In addition, if a user no longer wants the DApp's contract to have access to their tokens, they have to revoke the token approval, which requires another transaction to be sent.</p> <p>As a DApp developer on Moonbeam, this process can be easily avoided, providing your users with more control over their assets. This can be done using the batch precompile to batch an approval and swap into a single transaction, instead of the typical two transaction process. This allows for the approval amount to be the exact swap amount instead of having unlimited access to your users' tokens.</p> <p>In this tutorial, we'll dive into the process of batching an approval and swap into one transaction using the <code>batchAll</code> function of the batch precompile contract.

If not, you can use the <code>simpleDex.swapDevForDemoToken</code> function to acquire some DTOKs and add liquidity to the DEX.</p> <p>Now, we can approve the DEX to spend some DTOK tokens on our behalf so that we can swap the DTOKs for DEVs. On Ethereum, for example, we would need to send two transactions to be able to swap the DTOKs back to DEVs: an approval and a transfer. However, on Moonbeam, thanks to the batch precompile contract, you can batch these two transactions into a single one. This allows us to set the approval amount for the exact amount of the swap.</p> <p>So instead of calling <code>demoToken.approve(spender, amount)</code> and then <code>simpleDex.swapDemoTokenForDev(amount)</code>, we'll get the encoded call data for each of these transactions and pass them into the batch precompile's <code>batchAll</code> function. To get the encoded call data, we'll use Ether's <code>interface.encodeFunctionData</code> function and pass in the necessary parameters. For example, we'll swap .2 DTOK for .2 DEV. In this case, for the approval, we can pass in the DEX address as the <code>spender</code> and set the <code>amount</code> to .2 DTOK. We'll also set the <code>amount</code> to swap as .2 DTOK. Again, we can use the <code>ethers.parseEther</code> function to convert the amount in DTOK to Wei for us.</p> <p>Once we have the encoded call data, we can use it to call the <code>batchAll</code> function of the batch precompile. This function performs multiple calls atomically, where the same index of each array combine into the information required for a single subcall. If a subcall reverts, all subcalls will revert. The following parameters are required by the <code>batchAll</code> function:</p> <p>So, the first index of each array will correspond to the approval and the second will correspond to the swap.</p> <p>After the swap, we'll check the balances using the <code>checkBalances</code> function to make sure the balances have changed as expected.</p> <p>We'll update the <code>main</code> function to include the following logic:</p> <pre><code>async function main() {\n  // ...\n\n  // Parse the value to swap to Wei\n  const amountDtok = ethers.parseEther('INSERT_AMOUNT_OF_DTOK_TO_SWAP');\n\n  // Get the encoded call data for the approval and swap\n  const approvalCallData = demoToken.interface.encodeFunctionData('approve', [\n    simpleDexAddress,\n    amountDtok,\n  ]);\n  const swapCallData = simpleDex.interface.encodeFunctionData(\n    'swapDemoTokenForDev',\n    [amountDtok]\n  );\n\n  // Assemble and send the batch transaction\n  const batchAll = await batch.batchAll(\n    [demoTokenAddress, simpleDexAddress], // to address\n    [], // value of the native token to send \n    [approvalCallData, swapCallData], // call data\n    [] // gas limit\n  );\n  await batchAll.wait();\n  console.log(`Approve and swap DTOK tokens for DEV tokens: ${batchAll.hash}`);\n\n  // Check balances after the swap\n  await checkBalances(demoToken);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>So, if you set the amount to swap to be .2 DTOK, the DEX balance will increase by .2 DTOK, and the signing account's balance will decrease by .2 DTOK.

To swap ERTH to DEV, the path will be ERTH to WETH, so the path array will need to include the ERTH token address and the WETH token address: <code>[0x08B40414525687731C23F430CEBb424b332b3d35, 0xD909178CC99d318e4D46e7E66a972955859670E1]</code>.</p> <p>In addition to the ERTH and WETH addresses, to create a contract instance of the router contract, you'll also need the router address, which is <code>0x8a1932D6E26433F3037bd6c3A40C816222a6Ccd4</code>.</p> <p>The code will resemble the following:</p> <pre><code>// Define contract addresses\nconst erthTokenAddress = '0x08B40414525687731C23F430CEBb424b332b3d35';\nconst routerAddress = '0x8a1932D6E26433F3037bd6c3A40C816222a6Ccd4';\nconst wethTokenAddress = '0xD909178CC99d318e4D46e7E66a972955859670E1';\n\nasync function main() {\n  // Create contract instances for the ERTH token, the Uniswap V2 router contract,\n  // and the batch precompile\n  // ...\n\n  // Access the interface of the ERTH contract instance to get the encoded \n  // call data for the approval\n  const amountErth = ethers.parseEther('INSERT_AMOUNT_OF_ERTH_TO_SWAP');\n  const approvalCallData = earth.interface.encodeFunctionData('approve', [\n    routerAddress,\n    amountErth,\n  ]);\n\n  // Access the interface of the Uniswap V2 router contract instance to get\n  // the encoded call data for the swap\n  const swapCallData = router.interface.encodeFunctionData(\n    'swapExactTokensForETH',\n    [\n      amountErth, // amountIn\n      'INSERT_AMOUNT_OUT_MIN', // amountOutMin\n     [\n      erthTokenAddress, // ERTH token address\n      wethTokenAddress // WETH token address\n      ], // path \n     'INSERT_YOUR_ADDRESS', // to\n     'INSERT_DEADLINE' // deadline\n    ]\n  );\n\n  // Assemble and send the batch transaction\n  const batchAll = await batch.batchAll(\n    [erthTokenAddress, routerAddress], // to address\n    [], // value of the native token to send \n    [approvalCallData, swapCallData], // call data\n    [] // gas limit\n  );\n  await batchAll.wait();\n  console.log(`Approve and swap ERTH tokens for DEV tokens: ${batchAll.hash}`);\n}\nmain();\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>If you need the ABI to create a contract instance for any of the contracts in this example, all of the contracts are verified on Moonscan. So, you can search for the contract addresses on Moonscan and head to the Contract tab to get the Contract ABI.</p> <p>This will result in the approval and swap being batched into a single transaction and the transaction hash will be printed to the console.

This requirement creates an obstacle for dApps in terms of user experience, as a user needs to ensure they keep a balance of the native token to interact with the dApp.</p> <p>One solution to this problem is gasless transactions, also known as meta transactions. Gasless transactions are a type of transaction that does not require the user to pay for the gas required to execute the transaction. The gas for these transactions can be covered by a third-party service or it can be deducted from the user's balance of a different token, depending on the implementation. For example, a user could simply sign a message that represents the transaction to be submitted to the network, and then a third-party could submit the transaction and pay the transaction fees for the user.</p> <p>A regular transaction may have the following flow:</p> <p></p> <p>Whereas a gasless transaction may look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Gasless transactions can be especially beneficial for users that make small transactions frequently, as is the case with gaming dApps like Damned Pirates Society (DPS). In DPS, users go on voyages in search of treasure and with the goal of growing their fleet. There are two in-game currencies that are used in DPS: Treasure Maps (TMAP) and Doubloons (DBL). TMAP are used to buy voyages, and DBL are used to maintain flagships and buy support ships and can be earned while on voyages. Currently, if a user wants to start a voyage, they'll need TMAP to buy the voyage and GLMR to pay for transaction fees. Wouldn't it be ideal to lower the barrier to entry by implementing gasless transactions so users wouldn't need to worry about keeping a GLMR balance on top of their TMAP and DBL balances? From a dApp's perspective, it would keep users on their platform, as their users wouldn't need to leave the dApp to fund their GLMR balance; they could keep on gaming.</p> <p>Gasless transactions can be implemented using Moonbeam's Call Permit Precompile, which is a Solidity interface that allows a user to sign a permit, an EIP-712 signed message, that can then be dispatched by your dApp. The Call Permit Precompile can be used to execute any EVM call. The best part is that you don't need to modify your existing contracts!</p> <p>In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of implementing gasless transactions in a dApp. More specifically, we'll take a closer look at how we can implement gasless transactions to buy a voyage in DPS, as an example. We'll go over building an EIP-712 signed message, signing it, and dispatching it with the Call Permit Precompile.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/eth-api/call-permit-gasless-txs/#eip-712-signed-messages","title":"What are EIP-712 Signed Messages?","text":"<p>An EIP-712 signed message is a message that is structured, hashed, and signed in a standardized way. The benefit of the EIP-712 standardization is that message data can be displayed in a much more human-readable way for users signing these messages, so they can better understand what exactly they're signing. Before this standardization existed, users had to sign off on unreadable and difficult-to-decode hexadecimal strings, which made it easy for users to misplace their trust and sign off on messages with malicious data.</p> <p>The EIP-712 standard specifies how the message data should be structured by requiring developers to define a JSON structure of the message data that users will sign off on and specifying a domain separator.

Be sure to delete them, because we will be writing our own soon.  </p> <p>From here, there are a few things to do first before writing any code. First, we want to add a dependency to OpenZeppelin's smart contracts, because they include helpful contracts to use when writing token smart contracts. To do so, add them using their GitHub repository name:  </p> <pre><code>forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts\n</code></pre> <p>This will add the OpenZeppelin git submodule to your <code>lib</code> folder. To be sure that this dependency is mapped, you can override the mappings in a special file, <code>remappings.txt</code>:  </p> <pre><code>forge remappings &gt; remappings.txt\n</code></pre> <p>Every line in this file is one of the dependencies that can be referenced in the project's smart contracts. Dependencies can be edited and renamed so that it's easier to reference different folders and files when working on smart contracts. It should look similar to this with OpenZeppelin installed properly:</p> <pre><code>ds-test/=lib/forge-std/lib/ds-test/src/\nforge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/\nopenzeppelin-contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/\n</code></pre> <p>Finally, let's open up the <code>foundry.toml</code> file. In preparation for Etherscan verification and deployment, add this to the file:</p> <pre><code>[profile.default]\nsrc = 'src'\nout = 'out'\nlibs = ['lib']\nsolc_version = '0.8.20'\n\n[rpc_endpoints]\nmoonbase = \"https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network\"\nmoonbeam = \"INSERT_RPC_API_ENDPOINT\"\n\n[etherscan]\nmoonbase = { key = \"${MOONSCAN_API_KEY}\" }\nmoonbeam = { key = \"${MOONSCAN_API_KEY}\" }\n</code></pre> <p>The first addition is a specification of the <code>solc_version</code>, underneath <code>profile.default</code>. The <code>rpc_endpoints</code> tag allows you to define which RPC endpoints to use when deploying to a named network, in this case, Moonbase Alpha and Moonbeam. The <code>etherscan</code> tag allows you to add Etherscan API keys for smart contract verification, which we will review later.  </p>"},{"location":"tutorials/eth-api/foundry-start-to-end/#add-smart-contracts-in-foundry","title":"Add Smart Contracts","text":"<p>Smart contracts in Foundry destined for deployment by default belong in the <code>src</code> folder.

To create the deployment scripts, create a new file in the <code>script</code> folder:  </p> <pre><code>cd script\ntouch Container.s.sol\n</code></pre> <p>By convention, scripts should end with <code>s.sol</code> and have a name similar to the script they relate to. In this case, we are deploying the <code>Container</code> smart contract, so we have named the script <code>Container.s.sol</code>, though it's not the end of the world if you use a more suitable or descriptive name.  </p> <p>In this script, add:  </p> <pre><code>pragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\nimport \"forge-std/Script.sol\";\nimport {MyToken} from \"../src/MyToken.sol\";\nimport {Container} from \"../src/Container.sol\";\n\ncontract ContainerDeployScript is Script {\n    // Runs the script; deploys MyToken and Container\n    function run() public {\n        // Get the private key from the .env\n        uint256 deployerPrivateKey = vm.envUint(\"PRIVATE_KEY\");\n        vm.startBroadcast(deployerPrivateKey);\n\n        // Make a new token\n        MyToken token = new MyToken(1000);\n\n        // Make a new container\n        new Container(token, 500);\n\n        vm.stopBroadcast();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Let's break this script down. The first line is standard: declaring the solidity version. The imports include the two smart contracts you previously added, which will be deployed. This includes additional functionality to use in a script, including the <code>Script</code> contract.  </p> <p>Now let's look at the logic in the contract. There is a single function, <code>run</code>, which is where the script logic is hosted. In this <code>run</code> function, the <code>vm</code> object is used often. This is where all of the Forge cheatcodes are stored, which determines the state of the virtual machine that the solidity is run in.  </p> <p>In the first line within the <code>run</code> function, <code>vm.envUint</code> is used to get a private key from the system's environment variables (we will do this soon). In the second line, <code>vm.startBroadcast</code> starts a broadcast, which indicates that the following logic should take place on-chain. So when the <code>MyToken</code> and the <code>Container</code> contracts are instantiated with the <code>new</code> keyword, they are instantiated on-chain. The final line, <code>vm.stopBroadcast</code> ends the broadcast.  </p> <p>Before we run this script, let's set up some of our environment variables. Create a new <code>.env</code> file:  </p> <pre><code>touch .env\n</code></pre> <p>And within this file, add the following:  </p> <pre><code>PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY\nMOONSCAN_API_KEY=YOUR_MOONSCAN_API_KEY\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>Foundry provides additional options for handling your private key. It is up to you to decide whether or not you would rather use it in the console, have it stored in your device's environment, using a hardware wallet, or using a keystore.</p> <p>To add these environment variables, run the following command:  </p> <pre><code>source .env\n</code></pre> <p>Now your script and project should be ready for deployment! Use the following command to do so:  </p> <pre><code>forge script Container.s.sol:ContainerDeployScript --broadcast --verify -vvvv --legacy --rpc-url moonbase\n</code></pre> <p>This command runs the <code>ContainerDeployScript</code> contract as a script. The <code>--broadcast</code> option tells Forge to allow broadcasting of transactions, the <code>--verify</code> option tells Forge to verify to Moonscan when deploying, <code>-vvvv</code> makes the command output verbose, and <code>--rpc-url moonbase</code> sets the network to what <code>moonbase</code> was set to in <code>foundry.toml</code>. The <code>--legacy</code> flag instructs Foundry to bypass EIP-1559. While all Moonbeam networks support EIP-1559, Foundry will refuse to submit the transaction to Moonbase and revert to a local simulation if you omit the <code>--legacy</code> flag.</p> <p>You should see something like this as output:  </p> Script ran successfully.

Since some of the testing will be done on a development node, you'll also need to add the private keys of two of the prefunded development node accounts, which for this example, we can use Alice and Bob. In addition, you'll add your Moonscan API key, which can be used for both Moonbase Alpha and Moonbeam.</p> <p>You can modify the <code>hardhat.config.js</code> file to use any of the Moonbeam networks:</p> MoonbeamMoonriverMoonbase AlphaMoonbeam Dev Node <pre><code>    moonbeam: {\n      url: 'INSERT_RPC_API_ENDPOINT', // Insert your RPC URL here\n      chainId: 1284, // (hex: 0x504),\n      accounts: [privateKey]\n    },\n</code></pre> <pre><code>    moonriver: {\n      url: 'INSERT_RPC_API_ENDPOINT', // Insert your RPC URL here\n      chainId: 1285, // (hex: 0x505),\n      accounts: [privateKey]\n    },\n</code></pre> <pre><code>    moonbase: {\n      url: 'https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network',\n      chainId: 1287, // (hex: 0x507),\n      accounts: [privateKey]\n    },\n</code></pre> <pre><code>    dev: {\n      url: 'http://127.0.0.1:9944',\n      chainId: 1281, // (hex: 0x501),\n      accounts: [privateKey]\n    },\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Add your Moonscan API key, which is required for the verification steps we'll be taking later in this tutorial</li> </ol> <pre><code>// 1.

Your deployment script, named <code>DelegationDao.js</code>, should thus look like the following:</p> <pre><code>// 1. Import the required function from the Hardhat Ignition module\nconst { buildModule } = require('@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules');\n\n// 2. Define and export your deployment module using `buildModule`\nmodule.exports = buildModule('DelegationDAOModule', (m) =&gt; {\n  // 3. Specify the target collator address for the DAO\n  const targetCollator = '0x1C86E56007FCBF759348dcF0479596a9857Ba105';\n\n  // 4. Use the `getAccount` method to select the deployer account\n  const deployer = m.getAccount(0);\n\n  // 5. Deploy the `DelegationDAO` contract\n  const delegationDao = m.contract(\n    'DelegationDAO',\n    [targetCollator, deployer],\n    {\n      from: deployer,\n    }\n  );\n\n  // 6. Return an object from the module including references to deployed contracts, allowing the contract to be accessible for interaction in Hardhat tests and scripts\n  return { delegationDao };\n});\n</code></pre> <p>To run the script and deploy the <code>DelegationDAO.sol</code> contract, use the following command, which requires you to specify the network name as defined in your <code>hardhat.config.js</code>. If you don't specify a network, Hardhat will deploy the contract to a local Hardhat network by default. </p> <pre><code>npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/DelegationDao.js --network moonbeam --deployment-id INSERT_YOUR_NAME\n</code></pre> <p>You'll be prompted to confirm the network you wish to deploy to. After a few seconds after you confirm, the contract is deployed, and you'll see the contract address in the terminal.</p>  npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/DelegationDao.js --network moonbeam --deployment-id INSERT_YOUR_NAME \u2705 Confirm deploy to network moonbeam (1284)? \u2026 yes Hardhat Ignition \ud83d\ude80 Deploying [ DelegationDAOModule ] Batch #1 Executed DelegationDAOModule#DelegationDAO [ DelegationDAOModule ] successfully deployed \ud83d\ude80 Deployed Addresses DelegationDAOModule#DelegationDAO - 0x6D895A55F5ba31e582bCEe71cae394266F240e9b <p>Congratulations, your contract is live on Moonbeam!

For Web3, they refer to the specific JSON-RPCs that DApp developers use to send requests and receive responses from blockchain nodes, making it a crucial element in interactions with smart contracts. They allow frontend user interfaces to seamlessly interact with the smart contracts and provide users with real-time feedback on their actions. They also allow developers to deploy their smart contracts in the first place!  </p> <p>To get a JSON-RPC to communicate with a Moonbeam blockchain, you need to run a node. But that can be expensive, complicated, and a hassle. Fortunately, as long as you have access to a node, you can interact with the blockchain. Moonbase Alpha has a handful of free and paid node options. For this tutorial, we will be using the Moonbeam Foundation's public node for Moonbase Alpha, but you are encouraged to get your own private endpoint.  </p> <pre><code>https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network\n</code></pre> <p>So now you have a URL. How do you use it? Over <code>HTTPS</code>, JSON-RPC requests are <code>POST</code> requests that include specific methods for reading and writing data, such as <code>eth_call</code> for executing a smart contract function in a read-only manner or <code>eth_sendRawTransaction</code> for submitting signed transactions to the network (calls that change the blockchain state). The entire JSON request structure will always have a structure similar to the following:  </p> <pre><code>{\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"method\": \"eth_getBalance\",\n    \"params\": [\"0xf24FF3a9CF04c71Dbc94D0b566f7A27B94566cac\", \"latest\"]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This example is getting the balance (in DEV on Moonbase Alpha) of the <code>0xf24FF3a9CF04c71Dbc94D0b566f7A27B94566cac</code> account. Let's break down the elements:  </p> <ul> <li><code>jsonrpc</code> \u2014 the JSON-RPC API version, usually \"2.0\"</li> <li><code>id</code> \u2014 an integer value that helps identify a response to a request. Can usually just keep it as `</li> <li><code>method</code> \u2014 the specific method to read/write data from/to the blockchain. You can see many of the RPC methods on our docs site</li> <li><code>params</code> \u2014 an array of the input parameters expected by the specific <code>method</code> </li> </ul> <p>There are also additional elements that can be added to JSON-RPC requests, but those four will be seen the most often.  </p> <p>Now, these JSON-RPC requests are pretty useful, but when writing code, it can be a hassle to create a JSON object over and over again. That's why there exist libraries that help abstract and facilitate the usage of these requests. Moonbeam provides documentation on many libraries, and the one that we will be using in this tutorial is Ethers.js. Just understand that whenever we interact with the blockchain through the Ethers.js package, we're really using JSON-RPC!  </p>"},{"location":"tutorials/eth-api/how-to-build-a-dapp/#smart-contracts","title":"Smart Contracts","text":"<p>Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They serve as the decentralized backend of any DApp, automating and enforcing the business logic within the system.  </p> <p>If coming from traditional web development, smart contracts are meant to replace the backend with important caveats: the user must have the native currency (GLMR, MOVR, DEV, etc.) to make state-changing requests, storing information can be expensive, and no information stored is private.  </p> <p>When you deploy a smart contract onto Moonbeam, you upload a series of instructions that can be understood by the EVM, or the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Whenever someone interacts with a smart contract, these transparent, tamper-proof, and immutable instructions are executed by the EVM to change the blockchain's state. Writing the instructions in a smart contract properly is very important since the blockchain's state defines the most crucial information about your DApp, such as who has what amount of money.  </p> <p>Since the instructions are difficult to write and make sense of at a low (assembly) level, we have smart contract languages such as Solidity to make it easier to write them. To help write, debug, test, and compile these smart contract languages, developers in the Ethereum community have created developer environments such as Hardhat and Foundry.

When using JSON-RPC, Ethers.js likes to abstract degrees of interaction with the blockchain into objects, such as providers, signers, and wallets.  </p> <p>Providers are the bridge between the frontend user interface and the blockchain network, facilitating communication and data exchange. They abstract the complexities of interacting with the blockchain, offering a simple API for the frontend to use. They are responsible for connecting the DApp to a specific blockchain node, allowing it to read data from the blockchain, and essentially contain the JSON-RPC URL.  </p> <p>Signers are a type of provider that contain a secret that can be used to sign transactions with. This allows the frontend to create transactions, sign them, and then send them with <code>eth_sendRawTransaction</code>. There are multiple types of signers, but we're most interested in wallet objects, which securely store and manage users' private keys and digital assets. Wallets such as MetaMask facilitate transaction signing with a universal and user-friendly process. They act as a user's representation within the DApp, ensuring that only authorized transactions are executed. The Ethers.js wallet object represents this interface within our frontend code.</p> <p>Typically, a frontend using Ethers.js will require you to create a provider, connect to the user's wallet if applicable, and create a wallet object.

Note that we're only querying the last 10,000 blocks because otherwise the entire history of the blockchain would be queried and the RPC would timeout</li> <li>The resultant logs are parsed, and the most recent five are selected</li> </ol> <p>If we want to display them, we can do it like so:  </p> <pre><code>export default function PurchaseOccurredEvents({ contract }) {\n  // ...\n  return (\n    &lt;Grid item xs={12} marginTop={5}&gt;\n      &lt;TableContainer &gt;\n        &lt;Table&gt;\n          {/* TableHead Component */}\n          &lt;TableBody&gt;\n            {parsedLogs?.reverse().map((log, index) =&gt; (\n              &lt;TableRow key={index}&gt;\n                &lt;TableCell&gt;{log.minter}&lt;/TableCell&gt;\n                &lt;TableCell align='right'&gt;\n                  {utils.formatEther(log.amount)} tokens\n                &lt;/TableCell&gt;\n              &lt;/TableRow&gt;\n            ))}\n          &lt;/TableBody&gt;\n        &lt;/Table&gt;\n      &lt;/TableContainer&gt;\n    &lt;/Grid&gt;\n  );\n}\n</code></pre> PurchaseOccurredEvents.js file <pre><code>import { useLogs, useBlockNumber } from '@usedapp/core';\nimport { utils } from 'ethers';\nimport {\n  Grid,\n  Table,\n  TableBody,\n  TableCell,\n  TableContainer,\n  TableHead,\n  TableRow,\n} from '@mui/material';\n\nexport default function PurchaseOccurredEvents({ contract }) {\n  // Get block number to ensure that the useLogs doesn't search from 0, otherwise it will time out\n  const blockNumber = useBlockNumber();\n\n  // Create a filter &amp; get the logs\n  const filter = { args: [null, null], contract, event: 'PurchaseOccurred' };\n  const logs = useLogs(filter, { fromBlock: blockNumber - 10000 });\n  const parsedLogs = logs?.value.slice(-5).map((log) =&gt; log.data);\n  return (\n    &lt;Grid item xs={12} marginTop={5}&gt;\n      &lt;TableContainer&gt;\n        &lt;Table&gt;\n          &lt;TableHead&gt;\n            &lt;TableRow&gt;\n              &lt;TableCell&gt;Minter&lt;/TableCell&gt;\n              &lt;TableCell align='right'&gt;Amount&lt;/TableCell&gt;\n            &lt;/TableRow&gt;\n          &lt;/TableHead&gt;\n          &lt;TableBody&gt;\n            {parsedLogs?.reverse().map((log, index) =&gt; (\n              &lt;TableRow key={index}&gt;\n                &lt;TableCell&gt;{log.minter}&lt;/TableCell&gt;\n                &lt;TableCell align='right'&gt;\n                  {utils.formatEther(log.amount)} tokens\n                &lt;/TableCell&gt;\n              &lt;/TableRow&gt;\n            ))}\n          &lt;/TableBody&gt;\n        &lt;/Table&gt;\n      &lt;/TableContainer&gt;\n    &lt;/Grid&gt;\n  );\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This too should be added to <code>App.js</code>.</p> <pre><code>// ... other imports\nimport PurchaseOccurredEvents from './PurchaseOccurredEvents';\n\nfunction App() {\n  // ...\n\n  return (\n    {/* Wrapper Components */}\n      {/* Button Component */}\n      &lt;Card sx={styles.card}&gt;\n        &lt;h1 style={styles.alignCenter}&gt;Mint Your Token!&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;SupplyComponent contract={contract} /&gt;\n        &lt;MintingComponent contract={contract} /&gt;\n        &lt;PurchaseOccurredEvents contract={contract} /&gt;\n      &lt;/Card&gt;\n    {/* Wrapper Components */}\n  )\n}\n</code></pre> App.js file <pre><code>import { useEthers } from '@usedapp/core';\nimport { Button, Grid, Card } from '@mui/material';\nimport { Box } from '@mui/system';\nimport { Contract } from 'ethers';\nimport MintableERC20 from './MintableERC20.json'; \nimport SupplyComponent from './SupplyComponent';\nimport MintingComponent from './MintingComponent';\nimport PurchaseOccurredEvents from './PurchaseOccurredEvents';\n\nconst styles = {\n  box: { minHeight: '100vh', backgroundColor: '#1b3864' },\n  vh100: { minHeight: '100vh' },\n  card: { borderRadius: 4, padding: 4, maxWidth: '550px', width: '100%' },\n  alignCenter: { textAlign: 'center' },\n};\nconst contractAddress = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const { activateBrowserWallet, deactivate, account } = useEthers();\n  const contract = new Contract(contractAddress, MintableERC20.abi);\n\n  // Handle the wallet toggle\n  const handleWalletConnection = () =&gt; {\n    if (account) deactivate();\n    else activateBrowserWallet();\n  };\n\n  return (\n    &lt;Box sx={styles.box}&gt;\n      &lt;Grid\n        container\n        direction='column'\n        alignItems='center'\n        justifyContent='center'\n        style={styles.vh100}\n      &gt;\n        &lt;Box position='absolute' top={8} right={16}&gt;\n          &lt;Button variant='contained' onClick={handleWalletConnection}&gt;\n            {account\n              ?

We started with Hardhat, a powerful development environment that simplifies the process of writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts. Ethers.js, a popular library for interacting with Ethereum nodes, was introduced to manage wallets and transactions.  </p> <p>We delved into the process of writing smart contracts, highlighting best practices and key considerations when developing on-chain logic. The guide then explored useDApp, a React-based framework, for creating a user-friendly frontend. We discussed techniques for reading data from contracts, executing transactions, and working with logs to ensure a seamless user experience.</p> <p>Of course, there are more advanced (but optional) components of DApps that have popped up over time:</p> <ul> <li>Decentralized storage protocols \u2014 systems that store websites and files in a decentralized way</li> <li>Oracles \u2014 third-party services that provide external data to smart contracts within blockchains</li> <li>Indexing protocols \u2014 middleware that processes and organizes blockchain data, allowing it to be efficiently queried</li> </ul> <p>An excellent Web2 to Web3 blogpost is available if you are interested in hearing about them in depth.  </p> <p>Hopefully, by reading this guide, you'll be well on your way to creating novel DApps on Moonbeam!</p>      This tutorial is for educational purposes only.

A VRF is a cryptographic function that takes some input and produces random values, along with a proof of authenticity that these random values were generated by the submitter. The proof can be verified by anyone to ensure the random values generated were calculated correctly.</p> <p>There are two available sources of randomness that provide random inputs based on block producers' VRF keys and past randomness results: local VRF and BABE epoch randomness. Local VRF is determined directly within Moonbeam using the collator of the block's VRF key and the last block's VRF output. On the other hand, BABE epoch randomness is based on all the VRF produced by the relay chain validators during a complete epoch.</p> <p>For more information on the two sources of randomness, how the request and fulfillment process works, and security considerations, please refer to the Randomness on Moonbeam page.</p> <p>Moonbeam provides a Randomness Precompile, which is a Solidity interface that enables smart contract developers to generate randomness via local VRF or BABE epoch randomness using the Ethereum API. Moonbeam also provides a Randomness Consumer Solidity contract that your contract must inherit from in order to consume fulfilled randomness requests.</p> <p>This guide will show you how to use the Randomness Precompile and Randomness Consumer contract to create a lottery where the winners will randomly be selected.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/eth-api/randomness-lottery/#checking-prerequisites","title":"Checking Prerequisites","text":"<p>For this tutorial, you'll need the following:</p> <ul> <li>Create or have three accounts on Moonbase Alpha to test out the lottery contract</li> <li>All of the accounts will need to be funded with <code>DEV</code> tokens.

Precompiles are a part of the Substrate implementation and therefore cannot be replicated in the simulated EVM environment. This prohibits you from interacting with cross-chain assets on Moonbeam and Substrate-based functionality such as staking and governance.</p> <p>It's easy to create a fork with Tenderly. To do so, head to the Forks tab and take the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>Select Moonbeam or Moonriver from the Network dropdown</li> <li>(Optional) Give your fork a name</li> <li>If you only need data up until a specific block, you can toggle the Use Latest Block slider to off and specify the block number.

With the fork you just created, try calling the <code>transfer</code> function to send some FRAX from Baltathar to Alice like you did previously in the simulation section but without the state override. Unsurprisingly, this will fail because Baltathar has no balance of FRAX. But let's change that by minting some FRAX for Baltathar in our forked environment. To do so, take the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>Select the desired contract to interact with.</li> <li>Select the contract function you'd like to call. We'll choose <code>minter_mint</code> in this case.</li> <li>Enter Baltathar's address: <code>0x3Cd0A705a2DC65e5b1E1205896BaA2be8A07c6e0</code></li> <li>Enter the amount to mint, such as <code>10000000000000</code></li> <li>Minting is a privileged role in the FRAX contract. We need to specify the sender of this transaction in our fork as an authorized minter of the FRAX contract, which is <code>0x343e4f06bf240d22fbdfd4a2fe5858bc66e79f12</code></li> <li>Press Simulate Transaction</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Great!

This indicates that the simulation we're submitting now will build upon any state changes made in the prior one. If you notice an error indicating that the balance is insufficient, this could be a result of accidentally overriding the block number to use the same block number as the original <code>minter_mint</code> transaction.</p> <p>Tenderly also generates a custom RPC url for your fork, which looks something like <code>https://rpc.tenderly.co/fork/YOUR_UNIQUE_FORK_IDENTIFIER</code>.

It's also quite fast and requires minimal setup. In fact, if the contract you're investigating is already verified on chain, firing up the debugger is as easy as searching for the transaction hash on Tenderly. Let's try it out.</p> <p>In the upper search bar, you can paste a contract address or a transaction hash. Recall that Tenderly supports Moonbeam and Moonriver but does not currently support Moonbase Alpha. Here's an example transaction hash of a GLMR / FRAX swap on StellaSwap:</p> <pre><code>0x80c87ab47e077ca491045047389e6bd88a748ca24971a288d09608834a3bda07\n</code></pre> <p>After finding the transaction hash, you're greeted at the top with all of the typical statistics about the transaction, such as status, gas price, gas used, etc. Following that, you'll see a breakdown of the tokens transferred. And at the bottom you'll see a long list of every function call. Given that a swap is a relatively complex interaction, and given that StellaSwap uses upgradable proxy contracts, you'll see quite a long list in this example.</p> <p></p> <p>If you click on Contracts on the left-hand navigation bar, you'll see a list of every contract the transaction interacted with. You can click on a contract to see more details and view the entire source code if the contract is verified.</p> <p></p> <p>Heading down the left-hand navigation bar, you'll see an Events tab followed by a State Changes tab, which shows a visual representation of each change to the chain state that occurred as a result of this transaction.</p> <p></p> <p>If you scroll down to the Debugger tab, you'll be able to step through the contracts line by line and see key state information at the bottom, allowing you to pinpoint the source of any error.</p> <p></p> <p>Finally, you'll see a Gas Profiler, which will give you a visual representation of where and how the gas was spent throughout the course of the transaction. You can click on any of the function calls (represented by the blue rectangles) to see how much gas was spent in each call.</p> <p></p> <p>For a more detailed look, be sure to check out the How to Use Tenderly Debugger guide.

Transforming that data into the exact desired format will take place at a later step. In <code>processor.ts</code>, we'll need to indicate a data source, a contract address, the event(s) to index, and a block range.</p> <p>Open up the <code>src</code> folder and head to the <code>processor.ts</code> file.</p> <p>To get started, you can import the ERC-20 ABI, which will be used to define the ERC-20 data to be indexed:</p> <pre><code>import * as erc20 from './abi/erc20';\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we need to tell the SQD processor which contract we're interested in. Create a constant for the address in the following manner:</p> <pre><code>export const contractAddress = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS'.toLowerCase();\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>.toLowerCase()</code> is critical because the SQD processor is case-sensitive, and some block explorers format contract addresses with capitalization. Next, you'll see the line <code>export const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor()</code>, followed by <code>.setDataSource</code>. We'll need to make a few changes here. SQD has available archives for many chains, including Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase Alpha that can speed up the data retrieval process. For indexing a local development node, there's no archive necessary so the exclusive data source will be the RPC URL of our local node. Go ahead and comment out or delete the archive line. Once done, your code should look similar to the below:</p> <pre><code>.setDataSource({\n  chain: {\n    url: assertNotNull('http://127.0.0.1:9944'),\n    rateLimit: 300,\n  },\n})\n</code></pre> <p>The Squid template comes with a variable for your RPC URL defined in your <code>.env</code> file. You can replace that with the RPC URL for your local development node. For demonstration purposes, the RPC URL for a local development node is hardcoded directly, as shown above. If you're setting the RPC URL in your <code>.env</code>, the respective line will look like this:</p> <pre><code>RPC_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:9944\n</code></pre> <p>Now, let's define the event that we want to index by adding the following:</p> <pre><code>.addLog({\n  address: [contractAddress],\n  topic0: [erc20.events.Transfer.topic],\n  transaction: true,\n})\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>Transfer</code> event is defined in <code>erc20.ts</code>, which was auto-generated when <code>sqd typegen</code> was run. The import <code>import * as erc20 from './abi/erc20'</code> is already included as part of the Squid EVM template.</p> <p>Block range is an important value to modify to narrow the scope of the blocks you're indexing. For example, if you launched your ERC-20 at block <code>1200000</code> on Moonbeam, there is no need to query the chain before that block for <code>Transfer</code> events. Since we're indexing a local node, this field can be excluded or set to 0. Setting an accurate block range will improve the performance of your indexer.

We're installing version 0.8.20, as that is the version required by the <code>OracleClient</code> contract</p> <pre><code>npm i solc@0.8.20\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Add the following imports</p> deploy.js<pre><code>const fs = require('fs');\nconst solc = require('solc');\nconst { Web3 } = require('web3');\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Create the Web3 instance</p> MoonbeamMoonbase Alpha <pre><code>const web3 = new Web3('https://rpc.api.moonbeam.network');\n</code></pre> <pre><code>const web3 = new Web3('https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network');\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Create a function that compiles the <code>OracleClient</code> contract, saves the ABI in the <code>resources</code> directory for later use, and returns the ABI and bytecode for the deployment</p> deploy.js<pre><code>const compile = () =&gt; {\n  // Get path and load contract\n  const source = fs.readFileSync('OracleClient.sol', 'utf8');\n\n  // Create input object\n  const input = {\n    language: 'Solidity',\n    sources: {\n      'OracleClient.sol': {\n        content: source,\n      },\n    },\n    settings: {\n      outputSelection: {\n        '*': {\n          '*': ['*'],\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  // Compile the contract\n  const tempFile = JSON.parse(solc.compile(JSON.stringify(input)));\n  const contractFile = tempFile.contracts['OracleClient.sol']['OracleClient'];\n\n  // Save ABI to a file\n  fs.writeFileSync(\n    './resources/oracleClient.json',\n    JSON.stringify(contractFile.abi, null, 4),\n    'utf8'\n  );\n\n  return { abi: contractFile.abi, bytecode: contractFile.evm.bytecode.object };\n};\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Create the function to deploy the compiled contract. You'll need to pass the address of Supra's Pull contract to the constructor.

It is organized because the smart contract allows users to propose actions to be taken on chain in the form of transaction parameters, which are later executed with the smart contract as the origin. It is autonomous because the execution of the proposals is permissionless and thus does not depend on any specific person or team. It is decentralized because proposals are voted on by holders of the Compound Finance token.</p> <p>Let's take a look at the phases that a proposal in a DAO like Compound Finance's takes:  </p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Proposal \u2014 a user proposes that the DAO execute one or more transactions</li> <li>Voting \u2014 after a voting delay time period, a voting period opens, which allows users to vote with their voting weight. The voting weight is determined by a token balance snapshot typically taken sometime between the proposal start and the end of the voting delay period  </li> <li>Timelock \u2014 an optional period that allows users to exit the ecosystem (sell their tokens) before the proposal can be executed</li> <li>Execution \u2014 if the vote is successful, any user can trustlessly execute it</li> </ol> <p>But what about a cross-chain DAO? In a cross-chain DAO, the actions that you would typically take should also be available cross-chain: proposals, votes, executions, cancellations, etc. This requires a more complex architecture since a lot of information has to be replicated across chains.  </p> <p>There are many ways to architect a cross-chain DApp. You could make a more distributed system, where data and logic are distributed to multiple chains to maximize their use. On the other end of the spectrum, you could use a hub-and-spoke model, where the main logic and data are stored on a single chain and cross-chain messages will interact with it.  </p> <p></p> <p>Let's break down some of the steps in more detail:  </p> <ol> <li>Proposal \u2014 a user proposes that the DAO execute one or more transactions on the hub chain. A cross-chain message is sent to the satellite smart contracts on the spoke chains to let them know the parameters of the vote to take place  </li> <li>Voting \u2014 after a voting delay time period, a voting period opens, which allows users to vote with their voting weight on every chain. The voting weight is determined by a cross-chain token's balance on each chain at a certain timestamp between the proposal start and end  </li> <li>Collection \u2014 after the voting period, the cross-chain DAO on the hub chain sends a request to the spoke chains to send the voting results of each chain to the hub chain  </li> <li>Timelock \u2014 an optional period that allows users to exit the ecosystem (sell their tokens) before the proposal can be executed  </li> <li>Execution \u2014 if the vote is successful, any user can execute it trustlessly on the hub chain</li> </ol> <p>Note</p> <p>Take note of the new collection phase. This is where the cross-chain aspect changes the logic the most. Essentially, the votes on each spoke chain must be collected and submitted to the hub chain after the voting period is over.</p> <p>The process shown here makes it so that anyone can vote from across chains, so long as they hold the DAO token. For holding information that is read-only, we will be storing it on a single chain. Rare one-off actions such as proposals, cancellations, and so on are best done as a hub-and-spoke model. For information regarding voting logic, since users will be voting on multiple chains, voting weight and vote sums will be stored on each spoke chain and only sent to the hub chain after voting is over, since cross-chain actions are generally expensive.  </p> <p> </p> <p>This is, of course, only one way to implement a cross-chain DAO, and you are encouraged to think of alternative and better ways.

OpenZeppelin's <code>Governor</code> smart contract also has this feature, abstracting the tokens to votes feature into an <code>IVotes</code> interface.  </p> <p>The <code>IVotes</code> interface requires a lot of different functions to represent the different weights in a voting scheme. Fortunately, OpenZeppelin provides an ERC-20 implementation of <code>IVotes</code>, called ERC20Votes.  </p> <p>Recall from earlier that we intend to have users vote on each chain and to only send voting data to the hub chain during the collection phase. This means that the voting weights must be stored on each chain. This is very easy, since all we have to do is ensure that the <code>ERC20Votes</code> contract is deployed on each chain, or, in other words, make the DAO token a cross-chain token.  </p> <p>Previously, it was mentioned that LayerZero is being used as the cross-chain protocol for this tutorial. LayerZero was chosen because of their OFT contract, which makes it extremely easy to make an ERC-20 token cross-chain. This doesn't mean that you have to use LayerZero, though; every other cross-chain protocol has its own methods and the ability to create cross-chain assets.  </p> <p>We will create a new file named <code>OFTVotes.sol</code>:  </p> <pre><code>// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\n\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Votes.sol\";\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol\";\nimport \"@layerzerolabs/solidity-examples/contracts/token/oft/IOFT.sol\";\nimport \"@layerzerolabs/solidity-examples/contracts/token/oft/OFTCore.sol\";\n\nabstract contract OFTVotes is OFTCore, ERC20Votes, IOFT {\n    constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol, address _lzEndpoint) ERC20(_name, _symbol) OFTCore(_lzEndpoint) {}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>As you can see, <code>OFTVotes</code> is an abstract smart contract that inherits from the <code>OFTCore</code>, <code>ERC20Votes</code>, and <code>IOFT</code> smart contracts. If properly implemented, this will give it both cross-chain ERC-20 properties as well as voting properties. Let's add the following function overrides to the <code>OFTVotes</code> smart contract:  </p> <pre><code>function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual override(OFTCore, IERC165) returns (bool) {\n    return interfaceId == type(IOFT).interfaceId || interfaceId == type(IERC20).interfaceId || super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);\n}\n\nfunction token() public view virtual override returns (address) {\n    return address(this);\n}\n\nfunction circulatingSupply() public view virtual override returns (uint) {\n    return totalSupply();\n}\n\nfunction _debitFrom(address _from, uint16, bytes memory, uint _amount) internal virtual override returns(uint) {\n    address spender = _msgSender();\n    if (_from != spender) _spendAllowance(_from, spender, _amount);\n    _burn(_from, _amount);\n    return _amount;\n}\n\nfunction _creditTo(uint16, address _toAddress, uint _amount) internal virtual override returns(uint) {\n    _mint(_toAddress, _amount);\n    return _amount;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The first few functions are just ensuring compatibility with the smart contracts that they inherit from.</p> <p>The <code>_debitFrom</code> function is a little spicier: it includes logic to burn tokens so that the token bridge works. Similarly, the <code>_creditTo</code> function includes logic to mint tokens. These two functions are required by the <code>OFTCore</code> smart contract. If you are wondering why minting and burning are involved when most bridges wrap, it's because OFT teleports assets instead of wrapping them (similar to one of the XCM asset protocols).  </p> <p>The <code>OFTVotes</code> contract is abstract, so let's create a final smart contract that we'll deploy. In the <code>contracts</code> folder, create a new smart contract called <code>CrossChainDAOToken.sol</code> and add the following:  </p> <pre><code>// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\nimport \"./OFTVotes.sol\";\n\ncontract CrossChainDAOToken is OFTVotes {\n    constructor(uint256 _initialSupply, address _lzEndpoint)\n        OFTVotes(\"Cross Chain DAO Token\", \"CCDT\", _lzEndpoint)\n        ERC20Permit(\"Cross Chain DAO Token\")\n    {\n        _mint(msg.sender, _initialSupply);\n    }\n\n    // The functions below are overrides required by Solidity\n\n    function _afterTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal override(ERC20Votes) {\n        super._afterTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);\n    }\n\n    function _mint(address to, uint256 amount) internal override(ERC20Votes) {\n        super._mint(to, amount);\n    }\n\n    function _burn(address account, uint256 amount) internal override(ERC20Votes) {\n        super._burn(account, amount);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This smart contract isn't very special since all it really does is add metadata in the constructor and mint preliminary tokens to the user. All of the overridden functions are only there because of Solidity rules, and they simply default to a parent contract's implementation. The only reason we didn't add the metadata to <code>OFTVotes</code> is because, in theory, that smart contract could be reused elsewhere.  </p> <p>The <code>CrossChainDAOToken</code> smart contract is now ready for deployment on both spoke and hub chains. You can check its complete version in the example repository.  </p>"},{"location":"tutorials/interoperability/cross-chain-dao/#cross-chain-dao-contract","title":"Writing the Cross-Chain DAO Contract","text":"<p>Now to the meat of this tutorial: the cross-chain DAO. To be clear, not all of the cross-chain logic will be stored in the cross-chain DAO smart contract. Instead, we will separate the hub logic into one contract and the spoke chain logic into another.

For incoming messages, we must be able to receive the voting data from other chains during the collection phase. Like good software developers, we want to maintain extensibility; we might also want to receive messages from other chains that do other actions, like execute or propose. But we only get one payload in one receiving function! How do we resolve this issue?  </p> <p>Note</p> <p>For sake of simplicity, we won't implement cross-chain execution or proposals in this tutorial. The function selector concept is being introduced because it is an important topic in cross-chain DApps.  </p> <p>Let's think about the EVM. How does a smart contract know that a transaction wants to call a specific function? Each function has a function selector, a hashed value that is mapped to a specific action. We can do the same thing, but with cross-chain messages and with integers instead of hashes.  </p> <p>We'll update the <code>_nonblockingLzReceive</code> function as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Define the function selector as a <code>uint16</code> variable stored at the start of the bytes payload. From here on out, we will ensure in our design that every cross-chain message sent will have this <code>uint16</code> function selector at the start of its payload.</li> <li>Use assembly to load data at <code>payload's address + 32 bytes</code> into the <code>option</code> variable. Understanding why this is necessary requires a bit of understanding of how <code>abi.encode</code> works. The first 32 bytes of an ABI encoded payload are dedicated to information on the entire payload's size. After these first 32 bytes, the rest of the information is stored, which in this case is the function selector</li> <li>Based on the input of the <code>option</code> variable, perform some type of cross-chain action. For this example, the number <code>0</code> maps to the option to receive the voting data from the other chains. You could add additional functionality to the next number, <code>1</code>, such as proposing or executing</li> <li>If the <code>option</code> is <code>0</code>, we'll need to add functionality to receive the voting data. So, we'll call a function that will receive the voting data and pass in the <code>_srcChainId</code> and the newly unwrapped <code>payload</code> to this function.

Typically, this bytes payload is created from an invocation of <code>abi.encode</code>, where multiple types of data are inserted. For the smart contract that receives this data, the data must be decoded with <code>abi.decode</code>, where information is decoded in a manner that is expected. For example, if the receiving smart contract's logic requires a <code>uint16</code> and an <code>address</code> to function properly, it will decode by including <code>abi.decode(payload, (uint16, address))</code>.  </p> <p>When we have multiple functionalities packed into a message with a single payload, that payload might come in multiple formats, since different functions will require different bytes. Hence, we must examine the function selector before decoding the entire message.  </p> <p>Note</p> <p>The <code>abi.encode</code> function is used the most because it has the most support for dynamic types, but you could feasibly use <code>abi.encodePacked</code> if your use case permits. Assembly-level logic would have to change if you chose to make this change.</p> <p>We haven't written the <code>onReceiveSpokeVotingData</code> function yet.

While it may not matter as much when people can start voting, it does matter when the vote weight snapshot is made. If the vote weight snapshot is made too far apart between the spoke and hub chains, a user could send a token from one chain to another and effectively double their voting weight. Some example mitigation strategies are listed below, but they are too complex to investigate in detail for this tutorial. In the meantime, the only strategy is to subtract blocks from the current block based on the timestamp and a predetermined seconds-per-block estimate.  </p> <p>Now let's add logic to send vote results back to the hub chain:</p> <ol> <li>Retrieve the proposal ID from the cross-chain message</li> <li>Get the data for said proposal from the relevant map</li> <li>Encode that data into a payload as defined by the <code>CrossChainDAO</code></li> <li>Send that data through LayerZero</li> </ol> <pre><code>uint256 proposalId = abi.decode(_payload, (uint256));\nProposalVote storage votes = proposalVotes[proposalId];\nbytes memory votingPayload = abi.encode(\n    0, \n    abi.encode(proposalId, votes.forVotes, votes.againstVotes, votes.abstainVotes)\n);\n_lzSend({\n    _dstChainId: hubChain,\n    _payload: votingPayload,\n    _refundAddress: payable(address(this)),\n    _zroPaymentAddress: address(0x0),\n    _adapterParams: bytes(\"\"),\n    // NOTE: DAOSatellite needs to be funded beforehand, in the constructor.\n    //       There are better solutions, such as cross-chain swaps being built in from the hub chain, but\n    //       this is the easiest solution for demonstration purposes.\n    _nativeFee: 0.1 ether \n});\nproposals[proposalId].voteFinished = true;\n</code></pre> <p>The only issue here is that the gas payment for the cross-chain message's transaction on the hub chain must be included, and there is no simple way to receive it. There are options that could potentially avert this issue, as explained below, but for simplicity's sake, the satellite contract will have to be sent native currency every once in a while.  </p> <p>Finally, the last thing to add is a vote mechanism that allows users to vote. This mechanism is nearly exactly the same as the mechanism in the <code>GovernorCountingSimple</code> smart contract, so much of the code can be copied over:  </p> <pre><code>function castVote(uint256 proposalId, uint8 support) public virtual returns (uint256 balance)\n{\n    RemoteProposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalId];\n    require(\n        !proposal.voteFinished,\n        \"DAOSatellite: vote not currently active\"\n    );\n    require(\n        isProposal(proposalId), \n        \"DAOSatellite: not a started vote\"\n    );\n\n    uint256 weight = token.getPastVotes(msg.sender, proposal.localVoteStart);\n    _countVote(proposalId, msg.sender, support, weight);\n\n    return weight;\n}\n\nfunction _countVote(uint256 proposalId, address account, uint8 support, uint256 weight) internal virtual \n{\n    ProposalVote storage proposalVote = proposalVotes[proposalId];\n\n    require(!proposalVote.hasVoted[account], \"DAOSatellite: vote already cast\");\n    proposalVote.hasVoted[account] = true;\n\n    if (support == uint8(VoteType.Against)) {\n        proposalVote.againstVotes += weight;\n    } else if (support == uint8(VoteType.For)) {\n        proposalVote.forVotes += weight;\n    } else if (support == uint8(VoteType.Abstain)) {\n        proposalVote.abstainVotes += weight;\n    } else {\n        revert(\"DAOSatellite: invalid value for enum VoteType\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note that the <code>castVote</code> function requires that:  </p> <ul> <li>The proposal isn't finished</li> <li>The proposal exists, as in, there is data that's stored within the <code>proposals</code> map.</li> </ul> <p>In fact, the <code>_countVote</code> function is directly copied from the hub chain! Much of the logic of single-chain dApps can be reused in cross-chain dApps with minor tweaks.  </p> <p>That's it for breaking down the satellite contract. It was more or less simple because most of the logic is just a reflection of what happens on the hub chain.

Working off of logic that's meant for single-chain can get in the way several times, which you will find a common occurrence when working with cross-chain smart contracts.  </p> <p>For example, the <code>propose</code> function from the <code>Governor</code> smart contract couldn't be used and had to be replaced with a new cross-chain function. It would be best to completely remove the <code>propose</code> function, but that can't be done because of the way the <code>Governor</code> smart contract was designed. This is an obvious issue, and it goes to show that while it's good to prototype cross-chain DApps using preexisting smart contracts, it can be better to completely rewrite them while still reusing some logic.  </p> <p>Challenge</p> <p>Can you rewrite the <code>CrossChainDAO</code> smart contract to only include the logic and functions necessary for cross-chain interactions?

But instead of having a selector within a single smart contract, you could have cross-chain messages directed at multiple smart contracts that have special permissions within the <code>CrossChainDAO</code>. You may find this helpful in case you believe in single responsibility (SRP) for smart contracts.  </p> <p>For example, the hub chain's <code>CrossChainDAO</code> could be composed of the main contract that receives cross-chain data as well as two other smart contracts: <code>CrossChainExecutor</code> and <code>CrossChainProposer</code>. So, when interacting with the <code>DAOSatellite</code> contract to send a message to <code>CrossChainDAO</code>, the spoke chain's smart contract could target <code>CrossChainExecutor</code> to execute or <code>CrossChainProposer</code> to propose. This would remove the need to double-wrap payloads and the need to include function-selecting logic in the cross-chain message receiving function. It could even help convert a single-chain DAO into one with cross-chain abilities.  </p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"tutorials/interoperability/cross-chain-dao/#distributed-proposal-and-execution","title":"Distributed Proposal and Execution","text":"<p>What if you wanted users to be able to execute a proposal on multiple chains instead of just the hub chain?

In such a case where an execution could occur on multiple chains, you would have to have a smart contract on each chain that executes on behalf of the hub chain (which could be added to <code>DAOSatellite</code>). This smart contract would receive a message from the <code>execute</code> function provided by the <code>Governor</code> smart contract. This is simple enough, but it might be too many cross-chain messages to be efficient.  </p> <p>If you decide to completely decentralize the DAO, it would be most likely to remove the <code>DAOSatellite</code> smart contract and deploy a modified <code>CrossChainDAO</code> smart contract on every chain. Each <code>CrossChainDAO</code> could control the proposals meant to be executed on its chain. It would require a redesign of how proposals are made and sent, however.  </p> <p>You may also find an issue when generating the proposal ID. Take a look at how the IDs are being generated now:  </p> <pre><code>function hashProposal(\n    address[] memory targets,\n    uint256[] memory values,\n    bytes[] memory calldatas,\n    bytes32 descriptionHash\n) public pure virtual override returns (uint256) {\n    return uint256(keccak256(abi.encode(targets, values, calldatas, descriptionHash)));\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Conceivably, the same description and transaction details could be sent on both chain A and on chain B.

To do so, we'll be using a particular combination of XCM instructions that allow you to call Moonbeam's EVM through an XCM message. The unique twist to this tutorial is that rather than making a single remote EVM contract call, we'll be using Moonbeam's Batch Precompile to combine multiple EVM calls into a single transaction.</p> <p>To get the most out of this tutorial, you may wish to first familiarize yourself with Remote EVM Calls Through XCM as well as Moonbeam's Batch Precompile.</p> <p>The content of this tutorial is for educational purposes only!</p> <p>For this example, you'll be working on top of Moonbase Alpha (Moonbeam TestNet), which has its own relay chain called Moonbase relay (akin to the Polkadot relay chain). The relay chain token is called UNIT, while Moonbase Alpha's is called DEV. Importantly, you must understand that sending incorrect XCM messages can result in the loss of funds. Consequently, it is essential to test XCM features on a TestNet before moving to a production environment.</p> <p>The goal of this tutorial is to show you how the Batch Precompile can work in conjunction with Polkadot's XCM to allow you to trigger batch remote EVM calls on Moonbeam. To avoid adding complexity to this tutorial, the actual batch EVM calls we'll be making will be quite simple. We'll be initiating multiple mints of planet ERC-20 test tokens on Moonbase Alpha. Although we've chosen simple contract calls for demonstration purposes, there are lots more real-life defi examples that you may wish to emulate, such as token approvals and swaps, claiming rewards from multiple pools, or swapping and depositing into LP pools.</p> <p>Throughout this tutorial, we will refer to the account executing the batch EVM calls via XCM as Alice. Let's preview the flow of this tutorial:</p> <ol> <li>Alice has an account on the relay chain, and she wants to mint Mars (MARS) and Neptune (NEPT) tokens (ERC-20s on Moonbase Alpha) using Moonbase Minter. Alice needs to send an XCM message to Moonbase Alpha from her relay chain account</li> <li>The XCM message will be received by Moonbase Alpha and its instructions executed. The instructions state Alice's intention to buy some block execution time in Moonbase Alpha and execute a call to Moonbase's Batch Precompile, composed of two distinct mint calls. The batch EVM call is dispatched through a special account Alice controls on Moonbase Alpha via XCM messages. This account is known as the Computed Origin account. Even though this is a keyless account (private key is unknown), the public address can be calculated in a deterministic way</li> <li>The successful XCM execution will result in the mint commands being executed by the EVM, and Alice will receive her MARS and NEPT tokens in her special account</li> <li>The execution of the remote EVM call through XCM will result in some EVM logs that are picked up by explorers. There is an EVM transaction and receipt that anyone can query to verify</li> </ol> <p>The \"happy path\" of a remote batch EVM call dispatched via XCM is as follows: </p>"},{"location":"tutorials/interoperability/remote-batched-evm-calls/#checking-prerequisites","title":"Checking Prerequisites","text":"<p>Considering all the steps summarized in the introduction, the following prerequisites need to be accounted for:</p> <ul> <li>You need to have UNITs on the relay chain to pay for transaction fees when sending the XCM.

This includes:<ul> <li>Moonbase relay chain endpoint URL to create the provider</li> <li>Amount of tokens (in Wei) to withdraw from the Computed Origin account. For this example, <code>0.01</code> tokens are more than enough. To understand how to get this value, please refer to the XCM fee page</li> <li>The multilocation of the DEV token, as seen by Moonbase Alpha</li> <li>The weight for the <code>transact</code> XCM instruction. This can be obtained by multiplying <code>25000</code> by the gas limit obtained before. It is recommended to add approximately 10% more of the estimated value. You can read more about this value on the Remote EVM Calls through XCM page</li> <li>The Computed Origin account, as it will be needed later for an XCM instruction</li> <li>The bytes for the <code>transact</code> XCM instruction that we calculated in the previous section</li> </ul> </li> <li>Define the destination multilocation for the XCM message. In this case, it is the Moonbase Alpha parachain</li> <li>First XCM instruction, <code>WithdrawAsset</code>. You need to provide the asset multilocation and the amount you want to withdraw. Both variables were already described before</li> <li>Second XCM instruction, <code>BuyExecution</code>. Here, we are paying for Moonbase Alpha block execution time in DEV tokens by providing its multilocation and the amount we took out with the previous instruction. Next, we are buying all the execution we can (<code>Unlimited</code> weight) with <code>0.01 DEV</code> tokens which should be around 20 billion weight units, plenty for our example</li> <li>Third XCM instruction, <code>Transact</code>. The instruction will use a portion of the weight bought (defined as <code>requireWeightAtMost</code>) and execute the arbitrary bytes that are provided (<code>transactBytes</code>)</li> <li>Fourth XCM instruction, <code>DepositAsset</code>. Whatever is left in holding after the actions executed before (in this case, it should be only DEV tokens) is deposited into the Computed Origin account, set as the <code>beneficiary</code>.</li> <li>Build the XCM message by concatenating the instructions inside a <code>V3</code> array</li> <li>Create the Polkadot.js API provider</li> <li>Craft the <code>xcmPallet.send</code> extrinsic with the destination and XCM message.

You've sent an XCM message, which performed a remote EVM call to the Batch Precompile via XCM and resulted in the minting of MARS and NEPT ERC-20 tokens. But let's go into more detail about what happened.</p> <p>This action will emit different events. The first one is only relevant in the relay chain, and it is named <code>xcmPallet.Sent</code>, which is from the <code>xcmPallet.send</code> extrinsic. In Moonbase Alpha, the following events emitted by the <code>parachainSystem.setValidationData</code> extrinsic (where all the inbound XCM messages are processed) are of interest:</p> <ul> <li><code>parachainSystem.DownwardMessagesReceived</code> \u2014 states that there was an XCM message received</li> <li><code>evm.Log</code> \u2014 internal events emitted by the different contract calls. The structure is the same: contract address, topics, and relevant data</li> <li><code>ethereum.Executed</code> \u2014 contains information on the <code>from</code> address, the <code>to</code> address, and the transaction hash of an EVM call done</li> <li><code>polkadotXcm.AssetsTrapped</code> \u2014 flags that some assets were in holding and were not deposited to a given address. If the <code>Transact</code> XCM instruction does not exhaust the tokens allocated to it, it will execute a <code>RefundSurplus</code> after the XCM is processed. This instruction will take any leftover tokens from the execution bought and put them in holding. We could prevent this by adjusting the fee provided to the <code>Transact</code> instruction or by adding the instruction right after the <code>Transact</code></li> <li><code>dmpQueue.ExecutedDownward</code> \u2014 states the result of executing a message received from the relay chain (a DMP message). In this case, the <code>outcome</code> is marked as <code>Complete</code></li> </ul> <p>Our XCM was successfully executed! If you visit Moonbase Alpha Moonscan and search for the transaction hash, you'll find the call to the Batch Precompile that was executed via the XCM message. Note that you can only call the <code>mint</code> commands once per hour per planet. If you wish to experiment further and make additional mint calls, simply change the destination contract address to a different planet when configuring the batch call.</p> <p>Challenge</p> <p>Use the Batch Precompile and remote EVM calls via XCM to combine an approval and a Uniswap V2 swap of MARS for any other token you want. As a thought experiment, consider carefully which method of the Batch Precompile is best suited to combine an approval and a swap transaction. Both the Uniswap V2 Swap from Polkadot via XCM tutorial and the Batch Precompile tutorial are great resources to help you get started.</p>      This tutorial is for educational purposes only.

To do so, we'll be using a particular combination of XCM instructions that allow you to call Moonbeam's EVM through an XCM message. Consequently, any blockchain that is able to send an XCM message to Moonbeam can tap into its EVM and all the dApps built on top of it.</p> <p>The content of this tutorial is for educational purposes only!</p> <p>For this example, you'll be working on top of the Moonbase Alpha (Moonbeam TestNet), which has its own relay chain (similar to Polkadot). The relay chain token is called <code>UNIT</code>, while Moonbase Alpha's is called <code>DEV</code>. Doing this in TestNet is less fun than doing it in production, but developers must understand that sending incorrect XCM messages can result in the loss of funds. Consequently, it is essential to test XCM features on a TestNet before moving to a production environment.</p> <p>Throughout this tutorial, we will refer to the account performing the Uniswap V2 swap via XCM as Alice.

The instructions state Alice's intention to buy some block execution time in Moonbase Alpha and execute a call to Moonbase's EVM, specifically, the Uniswap V2 (Moonbeam-Swap) router contract. The EVM call is dispatched through a special account Alice controls on Moonbase Alpha via XCM messages. This account is known as the Computed Origin account. Even though this is a keyless account (private key is unknown), the public address can be calculated in a deterministic way</li> <li>The XCM execution will result in the swap being executed by the EVM, and Alice will receive her <code>MARS</code> tokens in her special account</li> <li>The execution of the remote EVM call through XCM will result in some EVM logs that are picked up by explorers.

Every validator in Axelar\u2019s network runs light nodes on chains that Axelar supports. In this demo, we'll interact with two Axelar contracts, one of which is the Axelar Gateway contract. The dynamic validator set uses this contract to monitor activity on each chain. Their role is crucial for achieving consensus, ensuring that messages are accurately transmitted from one chain to another</p> <p></p> <p>The other contract we will be working with is the Axelar Gas Receiver microservice. Whenever you use the Axelar Gateway to send a cross-chain transaction, the Gas Receiver lets you pay for the subsequent transaction on the destination chain.

This transaction automatically updates the destination chain and allows all transaction fees to be paid using the source-chain token already held by the user.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/interoperability/using-axelar-sdk/#building-the-cross-chain-nft-contract","title":"Building the Cross-Chain NFT Contract","text":"<p>We'll be deploying a simple contract that can only mint an NFT if it receives a specific cross-chain message. Minting the NFT will require a token payment, which will be wrapped DEV (Moonbase Alpha\u2019s native currency). A wrapped token for a native currency like DEV will mint one ERC-20 WDEV token for each DEV sent to it, and gives the option to redeem one WDEV token for one DEV. Using WDEV instead of native DEV is required because Axelar requires all tokens sent to be ERC-20s.</p> <p>So to mint in the cross-chain message, it must receive at least 0.05 WDEV.</p> <p>We\u2019re putting the same contract on two chains, so it must send and receive messages. From a high level, our contract does two things:</p> <ol> <li>Send an encoded address message with WDEV across chains via Axelar\u2019s Gateway with the option to pay for its gas on the destination chain</li> <li>Receive an encoded address message from Axelar, and execute only if it received at least 0.05 WDEV</li> </ol> <p>You\u2019ll be using a Hardhat project, but before we set it up, let\u2019s first take a look at a few parts of the contract. I encourage you to follow along!</p> <p>Contracts executed by the Axelar Gateway, like ours here, inherit from <code>IAxelarExecutable</code>. This parent contract has two overridable functions, <code>_execute</code> and <code>_executeWithToken</code>, that allow developers to change the logic when a contract receives a contract call from the Axelar Gateway. Both functions have the same inputs, but <code>_executeWithToken</code> also includes <code>tokenSymbol</code> and <code>amount</code> to describe the token being sent cross-chain.</p> <p>Now let\u2019s finally take a look at our mint function. It takes three inputs: a destination address, a destination chain, and the amount of WDEV to send. Remember that this mint function is called on the origin chain (Moonbase Alpha), which mints an NFT on a different destination chain.</p> mintXCNFT function <pre><code>function mintXCNFT(\n    string memory destinationAddress,\n    string memory destinationChain,\n    uint256 amount\n) external payable {\n    // Create the payload\n    bytes memory payload = abi.encode(msg.sender);\n\n    // Takes WDEV from the user and puts them into this contract for the Gateway to take        \n    wDev.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);\n    wDev.approve(address(gateway), amount);\n\n    // Pay for gas\n    // This is a gas service SPECIFICALLY for sending with token\n    gasService.payNativeGasForContractCallWithToken{value: msg.value}(\n        address(this),\n        destinationChain,\n        destinationAddress,\n        payload,\n        \"WDEV\",\n        amount,\n        msg.sender\n    );\n\n    // Call remote contract\n    gateway.callContractWithToken(\n        destinationChain,\n        destinationAddress,\n        payload,\n        \"WDEV\",\n        amount\n    );\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The logic itself has three steps. First, it takes WDEV from the caller. The caller must approve our NFT contract to transfer their WDEV beforehand. Then, our NFT contract approves the gateway to transfer the WDEV from the caller since the gateway contract will try to transfer the tokens from our NFT contract in the final step.</p> <p>Next, to pay for gas on the destination chain, we make use of the <code>IAxelarGasService</code> contract. This contract has many different configurations to pay for gas, like paying for <code>execute</code> versus <code>executeWithToken</code> or using an ERC-20 token as payment versus using native currency. Be careful if you plan on writing your own contract later!</p> <p>In this case, since the origin chain is Moonbase Alpha, the native currency is DEV. We can use native DEV to pay for gas on the destination chain based on the conversion rates between Moonbase Alpha\u2019s native currency and the destination chain\u2019s native currency. Since we\u2019re sending a contract call that includes a token to pay for destination gas in DEV, we will be using the <code>payNativeGasForContractCallWithToken</code> function.</p> <p>Finally, we call the gateway to send our cross-chain message with <code>callContractWithToken.</code> Notice that the payload (generic data that sent in a cross-chain call) that we\u2019re sending is just the caller\u2019s address. This data will need to be decoded by the destination contract.</p> <p>Now let\u2019s take a look at what happens on the destination chain. Since we expect tokens to be sent as payment for an NFT mint, we will override <code>_executeWithToken</code> from <code>IAxelarExecutable.</code></p> executeWithToken function <pre><code>// Mints the NFT for the user\nfunction _executeWithToken(\n    string memory, /*sourceChain*/\n    string memory, /*sourceAddress*/\n    bytes calldata payload,\n    string memory tokenSymbol,\n    uint256 amount\n) internal override {\n    require(\n        keccak256(abi.encodePacked(tokenSymbol)) == keccak256(\"WDEV\"),\n        \"Only WDEV is accepted\"\n    );\n    require(amount &gt;= 0.05 ether, \"Not enough to mint!\");\n\n    address user = abi.decode(payload, (address));\n\n    _mint(user, currentNFTID);\n    currentNFTID++;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In our implementation of <code>_executeWithToken</code>, we first check to ensure that the <code>tokenSymbol</code> provided by Axelar is \u201cWDEV\u201d. Then we expect 0.05 WDEV tokens for payment and will revert if any other token or anything less than 0.05 WDEV gets sent. Afterwards, we decode the payload to get the address of the origin chain\u2019s caller so that we can mint an NFT to that address. Finally, we finish the minting!</p> <p>You can find the full code for the <code>CrossChainNFT.sol</code> below.</p> CrossChainNFT.sol <pre><code>// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\n\npragma solidity ^0.8.9;\n\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol\";\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol\";\nimport \"@axelar-network/axelar-gmp-sdk-solidity/contracts/interfaces/IAxelarGasService.sol\";\nimport { AxelarExecutable } from '@axelar-network/axelar-gmp-sdk-solidity/contracts/executable/AxelarExecutable.sol';\n\n// Allows users to mint an NFT, but only cross chain\ncontract CrossChainNFT is ERC721, AxelarExecutable {\n    constructor(\n        address _gateway,\n        IAxelarGasService _gasService,\n        IERC20 _wDev\n    ) ERC721(\"Cross Chain NFT\", \"XCNFT\") AxelarExecutable(_gateway) {\n        gasService = _gasService;\n        wDev = _wDev;\n    }\n\n    uint256 currentNFTID;\n    IAxelarGasService gasService;\n    IERC20 wDev;\n\n    // Mints the NFT for the user\n    function _executeWithToken(\n        string memory, /*sourceChain*/\n        string memory, /*sourceAddress*/\n        bytes calldata payload,\n        string memory tokenSymbol,\n        uint256 amount\n    ) internal override {\n        require(\n            keccak256(abi.encodePacked(tokenSymbol)) == keccak256(\"WDEV\"),\n            \"Only WDEV is accepted\"\n        );\n        require(amount &gt;= 0.05 ether, \"Not enough to mint!\");\n\n        address user = abi.decode(payload, (address));\n\n        _mint(user, currentNFTID);\n        currentNFTID++;\n    }\n\n    function mintXCNFT(\n        string memory destinationAddress,\n        string memory destinationChain,\n        uint256 amount\n    ) external payable {\n        // Create the payload\n        bytes memory payload = abi.encode(msg.sender);\n\n        // Takes WDEV from the user and puts them into this contract for the Gateway to take        \n        wDev.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);\n        wDev.approve(address(gateway), amount);\n\n        // Pay for gas \n        // This is a gas service SPECIFICALLY for sending with token\n        gasService.payNativeGasForContractCallWithToken{value: msg.value}(\n            address(this),\n            destinationChain,\n            destinationAddress,\n            payload,\n            \"WDEV\",\n            amount,\n            msg.sender\n        );\n\n        // Call remote contract\n        gateway.callContractWithToken(\n            destinationChain,\n            destinationAddress,\n            payload,\n            \"WDEV\",\n            amount\n        );\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"tutorials/interoperability/using-axelar-sdk/#setting-up-the-repository","title":"Setting Up the Repository","text":"<p>Make sure to clone the GitHub repository for this tutorial.

I\u2019ve included some of the available networks and their faucets here:</p> Network Faucet Deployment Command Sepolia Faucet Link <pre><code>npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia</code></pre> Polygon Mumbai Faucet Link <pre><code>npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai</code></pre> Avalanche Fuji Faucet Link <pre><code>npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network fuji</code></pre> Fantom TestNet Faucet Link <pre><code>npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network fantom</code></pre> <p>After running a deployment command, you'll see output like the below. Be sure to copy the destination chain's contract address because you'll need to provide that later. </p> npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network moonbase Compiled 1 Solidity file successfully Nothing to compile Deployed CrossChainNFT on moonbase at: 0xB1972a5487A0Af15C47d321f25E25E8E3c3e8462"},{"location":"tutorials/interoperability/using-axelar-sdk/#building-the-mint-js-script","title":"Building the Mint.js Script","text":"<p>The minting contract is quite exciting and will require Axelar\u2019s SDK. At the top of the <code>mint.js</code> script, Ethers.js is initialized in a Hardhat script. The Axelar SDK is also initialized. There are multiple Axelar APIs available in the SDK, but in this case we will only be using the Axelar Query API since it includes all of the gas estimation functionality that we\u2019ll need for paying gas fees across chains.</p> <pre><code>const ethers = hre.ethers;\nconst axelarSDK = new AxelarQueryAPI({\n  environment: Environment.TESTNET,\n});\n</code></pre> <p>There are also some constants for you to change right after. This walkthrough is using Fantom as the destination chain, but you can use whichever chains you deployed to. Note that even though we\u2019re using a TestNet environment, Axelar refers to the chain names by their MainNet equivalents, hence why the origin chain is <code>moonbeam</code> and not <code>moonbase.</code></p> <pre><code>const ORIGIN_CHAIN = 'moonbeam';\nconst DESTINATION_CHAIN = 'ethereum-sepolia';\n// Address of CrossChainNFT printed in the console after running deploy script\nconst ORIGIN_CHAIN_ADDRESS = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';\n// Address of AxelarAcceptEverything.sol on Sepolia, you can change this \n// contract address to your own AxelarAcceptEverything.sol contract \nconst DESTINATION_CHAIN_ADDRESS = '0x89f801C7DB23439FDdBad4f913D788F13d1d7494'; \n</code></pre> <p>Next, we have to work with wrapped DEV to send across chains. First, we must wrap our DEV, and then we approve the contract on the origin chain to take some of our WDEV. This is necessary because the origin chain\u2019s contract has to send your WDEV to pay for minting the NFT on the destination chain.</p> <p>Note here that instead of hardcoding the WDEV contract address, we\u2019re using the <code>IAxelarGateway</code> contract to find the address. We could have also done this in the smart contract, but I wanted to show off how you would do it with Ethers.js. As expected, we sign two transactions: first to wrap 0.13 WDEV, then to approve our <code>CrossChainNFT</code> contract to send that WDEV.</p> <p>You may be wondering why we\u2019re wrapping 0.13 WDEV when the price of the mint is only 0.05. At the time of writing, Axelar collects a small fee (0.08 WDEV in this case) when transferring tokens between networks, which can be calculated on their website. Gateways do this automatically, but this responsibility may be delegated to the <code>IAxelarGasService</code>contract in the future.</p> <pre><code>const MOONBASE_WDEV_ADDRESS = await gateway.tokenAddresses('WDEV');\n\n// Wrap + Approve WDEV to be used by the NFT contract\n// wrap =&gt; transfer to contract =&gt; contract transfers to Gateway\nconst wDEVPayment = ethers.utils.parseUnits('0.13', 'ether');\nconst wDEV = await ethers.getContractAt('WETH9', MOONBASE_WDEV_ADDRESS);\n\nconst wrapTx = await wDEV.deposit({ value: wDEVPayment });\nconsole.log('Wrap transaction hash: ', wrapTx.hash);\n\nconst approveTx = await wDEV.approve(ORIGIN_CHAIN_ADDRESS, wDEVPayment);\nconsole.log('Approve transaction hash: ', approveTx.hash);\n\nconsole.log('Awaiting transaction confirmations...');\nawait ethers.provider.waitForTransaction(approveTx.hash, 1);\n</code></pre> <p>Now we have to estimate the amount of DEV that we send to the <code>mintXCNFT</code> function to pay for gas on the destination chain. This is where the Axelar SDK kicks in.</p> <p>We must estimate the amount of gas to spend on the destination chain because it is difficult to estimate a function that can only be called by a specific contract. In this case, we overestimate the amount of gas we will spend as <code>400,000</code>. In an actual production environment, you should benchmark the amount of gas that you spend. However, if you do end up overestimating by a lot, you will get refunded by Axelar\u2019s gas services.</p> <p>The estimateGasFee function provided by the Axelar SDK will find the conversion between the origin chain\u2019s native currency and the destination chain\u2019s native currency to find the right amount to send to the destination chain.</p> <p>You, the astute reader, might wonder why we\u2019re using <code>GLMR</code> instead of <code>DEV</code>. Similar to how Axelar uses the MainNet chain names instead of using the TestNet names, Axelar will interpret <code>GLMR</code> as <code>DEV</code> since we\u2019re using the TestNet environment.</p> <pre><code>const estimateGasUsed = 400000;\nconst gasFee = await axelarSDK.estimateGasFee(\n  ORIGIN_CHAIN,\n  DESTINATION_CHAIN,\n  GasToken.GLMR,\n  estimateGasUsed\n);\nconst gasFeeToHuman = ethers.utils.formatEther(ethers.BigNumber.from(gasFee));\nconsole.log(`Cross-Chain Gas Fee: ${gasFee} Wei / ${gasFeeToHuman} Ether`);\n</code></pre> <p>Calling this function from the SDK will return a string representing the amount of DEV WEI to pay, like <code>241760932800000</code>. That\u2019s hard for us simple humans to understand, so we use Ethers.js to convert it into a more human-readable version to print to the console later.</p> <pre><code>const gasFeeToHuman = ethers.utils.formatEther(ethers.BigNumber.from(gasFee));\n</code></pre> <p>Finally, we call the <code>mintXCNFT</code> contract function. The important takeaway here is that we\u2019re sending the gas fee not as a gas limit but as value. Ethers.js can calculate how much gas to send on the origin chain. However, to pay for the destination chain, we have to calculate with the Axelar SDK and send it as value to the <code>IAxelarGasReceiver</code> contract.</p> <pre><code>// Begin the minting\nconst mintRes = await nft.mintXCNFT(\n  DESTINATION_CHAIN_ADDRESS,\n  DESTINATION_CHAIN,\n  wDEVPayment,\n  { value: gasFee }\n);\nconsole.log('Minting transaction hash: ', mintRes.hash);\n</code></pre> <p>That\u2019s the entire script! Before we run the script, check again to make sure that the four constants (<code>ORIGIN_CHAIN</code>, <code>DESTINATION_CHAIN</code>, <code>ORIGIN_CHAIN_ADDRESS</code>, <code>DESTINATION_CHAIN_ADDRESS</code>) at the top of the script are set correctly.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the command to mint your NFT!</p> <pre><code>npx hardhat run scripts/mint.js --network moonbase\n</code></pre> <p>The console should output something similar to this:</p> npx hardhat run scripts/mint.js --network moonbase Nothing to compile Wrap transaction hash:  0x89bd6c42c9b7791ce51a0ef74e83fa46fc063eefcd838def3664cb12970156cd Approve transaction hash:  0x1594d43444d1f8abdadcab78098452d8b25a9eed72c89597c1b9822b5a8e1605 Awaiting transaction confirmations...

So don\u2019t lose it! But if you do, you can look at all of the recent transactions on Axelar\u2019s TestNet scanner.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/interoperability/using-axelar-sdk/#viewing-axelar-transaction-status","title":"Viewing Axelar Transaction Status","text":"<p>Axelar has a TestNet explorer, and a successful transaction for the interaction you just completed would look something like this:</p> <p></p> <p>It's a good idea to try out the SDK to view the status of your transactions because it gives more information about your transaction and any possible errors. To do this, I wrote a Hardhat task for us to use. You can view the code in <code>axelarStatus.js</code>, but we\u2019ll take a dive here too.</p> <p>The main meat of the code is in these five lines. First, we initialize the SDK module that we will be using, the <code>AxelarGMPRecoveryAPI</code>. Unlike the <code>AxelarQueryAPI</code> that we used in the minting script, the <code>AxelarGMPRecoveryAPI</code> helps track and recover stalled transactions. Next, we have to query the transaction status, and the SDK takes care of it for us.</p> <pre><code>const sdk = new AxelarGMPRecoveryAPI({\n  environment: Environment.TESTNET,\n});\nconst txStatus = await axelarSDK.queryTransactionStatus(txHash);\nconsole.log(txStatus);\n</code></pre> <p>You can learn a bit more about the <code>AxelarGMPRecoveryAPI</code> in Axelar\u2019s documentation. It includes additional functionality in case a transaction goes wrong, especially if there isn\u2019t enough gas sent along with the cross-chain transaction.</p> <p>The <code>axelarStatus.js</code> file is configured as a Hardhat task rather than a script, which means that the command to run it will differ slightly from the command style required to execute a script. Be sure to note these differences and carefully craft the below command, replacing <code>INSERT_TRANSACTION_HASH</code> with the transaction of hash on the origin chain that you sent a cross-chain message in:</p> <pre><code>npx hardhat axelarStatus --tx INSERT_TRANSACTION_HASH\n</code></pre> <p>If you run the Hardhat script, you\u2019ll end up with something like this in your console (I didn\u2019t include all of it since it\u2019s so large). You\u2019re likely most interested in the status, where a list of possible ones is in Axelar\u2019s documentation.
